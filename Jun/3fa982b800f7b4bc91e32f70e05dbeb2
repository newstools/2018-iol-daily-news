Viraksha Chetty is currently in Spain where she and her husband, Vikesh Ramoutar, are celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary. She told the Daily News she was at a loss for words after being given the opportunity to attend the two-week Women in Transformation Programme in October. “I am overwhelmed and thankful for this amazing, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” said Chetty, an accountant in Mandeni, just outside KwaDukuza. The mother of two girls - Suvarna, 7, and 1-year-old Riddhi - said: “This is really a dream come true. Oxford University is known for its rich history, discipline and best international standards. I look forward to networking, and learning in a world-class environment.” Regent Business School is part of the Honoris United Universities - a network of higher education institutions in Africa. It is through Actis, its bursary wing, that Chetty was given the opportunity. Two other students from the network were also given the chance to further their studies, but at different universities. According to Chetty, the course is designed to empower and enhance women within the global framework. “I am driven towards being a motivated and strong leader, initiating change and development in South Africa.” At the end of the programme, Chetty will be awarded a certificate of completion, but she has not yet decided how she will put the skills to use. Dr Ahmed Shaikh, the managing director of Regent Business School, said: “I am absolutely delighted that one of our students has won the opportunity to gain such invaluable experience at one of the most prominent institutions in the world.” He said he was proud of Chetty’s achievement.
