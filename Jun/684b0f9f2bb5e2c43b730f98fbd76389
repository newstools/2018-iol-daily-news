Durban - Residents of an informal housing settlement in Clairwood are mourning the death of a woman who died when a fire engulfed the shacks on Saturday. The fire allegedly began in one of the shacks and spread rapidly onto others at the Sirdar Road informal settlement. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KZN police spokesperson, confirmed that a woman was found dead among the burnt out shacks. Gwala said the cause of the fire is unknown. "The identity of the woman is not known. Police are trying to contact family members who can identify her," Gwala said. Sharmaine Sewshanker, Democratic Alliance PR councillor for Clairwood, said an estimated 40 shacks were totally destroyed. She said about 50 people were displaced by the fire. She said many of the residents had rebuilt their shacks. "After the fire department had doused the flames they began checking the ruins. That is when they found the body among the burnt and twistedÂ metal sheets of the shacks," Sewshanker said. Local businesses and residents rallied together to provide breakfast and lunch for the affected residents. Sewshanker said many of them could not salvage anything. "They had lost all of their possessions including ID documents and clothing," she said. An inquest docket was opened for investigation by Brighton Beach SAPS. Daily News
