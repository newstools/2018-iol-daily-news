The woman said her 8-year-old son was playing soccer when his ball accidentally flew into a girl’s face. The girl’s father then allegedly hit her son, leaving him with a hole in the head. “He hit him with an unidentified object which left an open wound on my son’s head,” said the mother. Shortly afterwards a 26-year-old man was arrested, but was later given overnight bail. The Grade 3 Collingwood Primary pupil was rushed to Entabeni Hospital, where he underwent facial reconstruction surgery. “The doctor said the object that hit him grazed his skull and the surgery alone cost over R32 000, but the person who did this has not been held accountable,” said the mother. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm was opened at the Wentworth police station and a 26-year-old man appeared in the Wentworth Magistrate’s Court on June 5. The boy’s mother said not enough was being done because police had not yet approached them for a statement. Her son was still recovering from the operation, and would only be fit to return to school next term. Daily News
