Durban - The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) has called for pure Mathematics to be made a compulsory subject and not History. Wayne Thring, ACDP deputy president said they are aware of the comments made by Angie Motshekga, Minister of Basic Education, on receiving the 156-page report from the History Ministerial Task Team. The task team wants History to be introduced as a compulsory subject in grades 10, 11 and 12. Thring said History should enable learners to be active citizens but they cannot agree with making History a compulsory subject in grades 10, 11 and 12. “Firstly, and most importantly, South Africa faces many challenges on the economic front, with high unemployment rates, increasing poverty and critical skill shortages,” he said. “As we surge ahead towards the 4th Industrial Revolution, for the ACDP, it is a no-brainer, make pure Mathematics a compulsory subject up to Grade 12 and not History.” “Secondly, while the Minister mentioned that, “This project is not a propaganda exercise destined to shore up and buttress support for the oldest liberation movement in Africa, the ANC”, one has to question whether this is believable,” he continued. “Finally, it must be noted that the ACDP is not opposed to an Afrocentric approach to teaching History as a subject. We do caution against History being used as a propagation tool, and believe that nine years of compulsory History teaching is sufficient time to achieve a desired empirical outcome,” he said. He also said in order for South Africa to compete internationally and lift itself out of the current economic stagnation, with all of its negative consequences, they should be paying more attention to the pure Sciences, which includes Mathematics, and not History.
