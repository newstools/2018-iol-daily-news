Durban - A truck transporting a crane caused traffic disruption on Tuesday when it got stuck under a bridge on the M19. Durban Metro Police spokesman Parboo Sewpersad said illegal abnormal loads were a major problem causing traffic disruptions and damage to roads and infrastructure. "The driver was travelling on the M19 westbound under the N2 bridge, Pinetown bound. Two lanes were obstructed as a result. He then reversed and went off in another direction, but not without disrupting traffic," he said. Upon investigation, police found that the driver did not have the correct permits in place for the load. "We have a major problem with these pirate abnormal loads. Companies are supposed to get the necessary permits so that official escorts and the best, safest routes can be planned for their loads. But they bypass the system to avoid the cost," said Sewpersad. He said it costs R10 000 per police member involved in escorting such loads. "We have to have members and vans in the front and rear of these loads and plan proper routes for safety reasons. So drivers take routes they're not authorized to take, routes that are not designed for them. The result is not just road disruptions, but also damage to roadways and infrastructure," said Sewpersad. He said Metro Police were going to come down hard on offenders. "A few of the drivers have also tried to bribe our officers in order to make their way through. We are not tolerating this and send a stern warning that action will be taken against these drivers and companies," he said. Daily News
