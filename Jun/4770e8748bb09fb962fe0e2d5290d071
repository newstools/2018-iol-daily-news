Durban - Police have vowed to get to the bottom of who was responsible for shooting a Durban Metro Police officer in the foot during violent protests on the M25 near Phoenix on Tuesday. Metro Police spokesperson, Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad said their officers were called to up to 12 protests a day on average and this was not the first time their officers had come under attack. “We need to take a stance on this now,” Sewpersad said. “Metro Police has been at the forefront of these protests... Whether it is political, strike-related, service delivery related and others, we have been there and this is not the first time our officers have come under attack. This is a serious concern for us. We need to take a stance against these attacks,” he said. Police spokesperson, Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said it is believed the protests were linked to issues with local RDP housing and service delivery. “The officer was assisting during the protest when a shot rang off. It is believed that someone from the crowd opened fire on the officer and his colleagues. The road and area is cleared now, but police are maintaining a high presence there,” said Zwane. Members from Bhambayi community, near Phoenix, burned tyres and threw stones at passing motorists. “We have opened cases of attempted murder public violence. We condemn these incidents and will take action on the matter,” said Zwane. Daily News
