The two classic car enthusiasts who came up with the idea - John Aritho and Avish Maharaj - envisage that the Concours d’Elegance Durban will eventually become one of the best events held in Africa. A conversation over dinner about the need for a "beautiful motoring event" will culminate in the first display of about 200 “of the most elegant” collector’s cars at the Durban Country Club on Sunday, August 12. Concours d’Elegance, which dates back to 17th century France, is a competition of the most elegant, prestigious cars. It is held in various parts of the world, the most famous being Pebble Beach, in America, which started in 1915. With Durban Tourism on board, the plan is to make the event Durban’s own Pebble Beach, guests at the Durban Country Club for the media launch were told on Wednesday. Aritho said that in trying times such as we lived in now, an event like this would “bring a bit of happiness” to people. “It is going to be epic.” Aritho added that the iconic Durban Country Club, with its picturesque ocean backdrop, was the perfect venue. The Association for the Aged (Tafta) will be the charity beneficiary of choice, with Maharaj, the event’s co-organiser, describing the elders as “our timeless classics”. Daily News
