His son, AB Moosa Jnr, confirmed the news. “It’s a time where we feel heavy hearted for this loss of someone who was an amazing husband, father and grandfather,” he said. AB said his family was overwhelmed by messages of support. “The amount of messages that have been pouring in nationally and internationally from so many people has been overwhelming. So many people have admired my father and commented on him being a gentleman and on his integrity. We are going to miss him very much,” he said. AB said one message perfectly summed up who his father was. “The great Avalon Cinemaland legend is no more... his part in ‘this movie of life has ended’... The great director and scriptwriter has ordered a total recall. My dear Moosa Aboobaker Moosa you played out your part with honour, honesty, integrity, smartness and respect. We the audience salute you, take a bow... The community and the entire “audience” salute you for all whose lives you have touched” (sic). Messages have been streaming in on social media. Satish Dhupelia said: “Sad news as we bid farewell to Mr Moosa Moosa - a real gentleman and a visionary. Our sympathies to his family.” Yogin Devan said: “A true gentleman...a legend of the silver screen. Condolences to AB and family.” Smeetha Maharaj said: “Condolences to AB and family on the sad demise of Mr Moosa. We will always remember him with fond memories of bringing the best in entertainment and cinematic excellence. Always there to welcome us so warmly to the movie premières. He will be sadly missed. RIP Mr Moosa.” Co-founded in 1939, the Avalon Group is South Africa’s largest and oldest independent cinema company. AB Moosa Jnr joined his father in the business in 1991, which at the time had been reduced to only one cinema screen because of apartheid laws. Together they rebuilt Avalon into a force in the South African cinema industry. Moosa’s funeral was expected to take place in Johannesburg on Monday. Daily News
