Durban - A suspect who had allegedly targetted elderly people living on in the Umhlali area on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast was shot dead just minutes after he had robbed his latest victim. The man was shot by private security guards who tracked him down after residents raised the alarm shortly after he robbed a sleeping 73-year-old woman. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed on Tuesday the dead robber has been linked to at least two other cases in the area. In a statement released on Monday police said a 73-year-old woman was asleep in her house at Salt Rock when she was attacked by the armed suspect. “She was allegedly threatened with a shotgun and robbed of her cellphone, cash as well as other items. The victim immediately contacted a local security company who responded. The suspect was traced close to the scene and when security guards attempted to apprehend him, a shootout ensued which resulted in the death of the suspect,” said Zwane. He said an unlicensed shotgun believed to be the same weapon used during the robbery was seized. “A case of armed robbery as well as an inquest docket was opened at Umhlali police station for further investigation. It is believed that the shotgun was taken from a house during an armed robbery in May this year,” said Zwane. Daily News
