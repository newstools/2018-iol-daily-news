Durban - Workers who were busy at a building site in Inanda stumbled on the remains of an infant when they were trying to dig an area up for an outside toilet and wash facility. Property owner Sazi Shandu said workers found the baby’s remains around 3.30pm on Tuesday. “It looked like a baby. The bones were very small,” said Shandu. When the Daily News arrived on the scene at around 11am on Wednesday, police had reportedly left just minutes before with the remains. However the baby’s Mickey Mouse blanket and blue woollen bonnet remained at the makeshift grave. The former owner of the land, Sandile Mtolo was also at the site. He said the land had been in his family for more than 10 years, but that nobody from his family stayed there. “Over the years different squatters came. Some set up wooden houses. But the occupants changed from time to time. I also live in Inanda. On Tuesday Mr Shandu called me about the baby’s body. I came over immediately. But I don’t know whose baby this could be. My family hasn’t lived on this property for many years. It has been used up mainly by squatters,” he said. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, said: “An inquest docket is being investigated by Inanda SAPS after human skeletons were recovered this morning at Bhambayi, Inanda area. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated.” Daily News
