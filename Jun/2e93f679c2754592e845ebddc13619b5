Durban- The Diakonia Council of Churches has distanced itself from the night vigil that will be hosted by the National Interfaith Council of South Africa on the eve of former president, Jacob Zuma’s court appearance on Friday. In a statement that was released on Wednesday, Nomabelu Mvambo Dandala, executive director at the organisation said they do support the vigil and the march the following day to the Durban high Court where Zuma is expected to appear. “As the Council of Churches, we stand firm for peace, hope, truth and justice;especially in light of the very heavy political discourse currently occurring in our country and province. We find it extremely inappropriate as the church to lobby for politicians especially when churches are made up of people from diverse political affiliations,” she said. She said the events were not organised by Diakonia meaning that the “mainline churches” were not a part of it. This comes as Durban city centre prepares to go on lockdown as Zuma faces corruption charges. A vigil is expected to be held on Thursday with a march to the high court on Friday. Dandala said she hoped that there would be a peaceful outcome and that the organisation had faith in the country’s justice system. “We appeal to the churches to continue to pray for peace and justice and an end to politically motivated and taxi related violence, car hijackings and the wave of criminality which has become common in our province,” she said. Reverend Thamsanqa Mvambo, Nicsa’s secretary general said people who organised the vigil did not do it under the banner of the organisation. Mvambo said this was the work of a few individuals and not the organisation. “As Nicsa we are disappointed that individuals use the name of the organisation without consultation,” Mvambo said.
