And with these included, he has signed up for a four-bedroomed R12.5million penthouse, complete with private swimming pool at the Saxony Sibaya. Amla, an ambassador and investor in the new development that will be officially launched next month, will relocate from his home in a complex in uMhlanga to Saxony Sibaya, near uMhloti in 2020, when the property is due to be finished. And he is not the only international sportsman interested in the project either, said Amla’s agent and business partner Ismail Kajee, who has also signed up for a penthouse near Amla’s. “There are other sporting stars who want to live here,” confided Kajee as the Saxony Sibaya model was unveiled to journalists yesterday. Amla, a father of three, said he was particularly pleased that he would be able to drive right up to his penthouse. “That’s important when you have to carry your children into your home late at night from your car,” he said, adding that there would also be a live in quarters for domestic staff.  And as someone who enjoys his privacy, he was impressed with the security arrangements at Saxony. For someone who travels, he liked that it was close to the airport. “The look of the whole development is also very pleasing to the eye,” he said. The project, by Saxony Developments, boasts 100 luxury apartments, a three-level cascading pool and lap pool, his and her sauna and steam rooms and a fully-equipped gym, among other facilities. “Throughout my career, I’ve been exposed to some great investment opportunities, and I’ve realised lately that the best investment returns are from off-plan residential developments. “The Sibaya Coastal precinct is by far the fastest growing residential node in the country right now, and I jumped at the opportunity to invest,” Amla said.
