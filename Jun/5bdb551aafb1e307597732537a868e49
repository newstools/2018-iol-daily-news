Ironically, the mayor’s comments came while sub-contractors involved in waste removal were on strike, and displayed their anger by dumping bags of rubbish on the streets. Nick Holmes tweeted: “I wonder what “damn clean” is in comparison to? The state of governance? Financial mismanagement? Running of her office?” Olwethu Sipuka suggested: “She must visit @Specsavers.” Some questioned where Gumede was when she made the remark. @Pikkie Greef tweeted: “Is she sure she is in Durban? Or does she mistake Umhlanga for Durban?” DA caucus leader Nicole Graham tweeted “maybe she has special mayoral goggles”. DA councillor Heinz de Boer said: “It is very strange that she said that. She must look at the litter in the morning around the CBD, and rural settlements are also in a super untidy state.” IFP councillor Mdu Nkosi wanted to know “which part is clean?” He said “there is enough staff, but no management. Durban needs to be clean at all times, not only at night.” The Daily News drove through the city just before 11am on two days this week and found that most places were fairly clean. This included spots like Warwick Triangle, the Workshop area and Dr Pixley kaSeme Street. Responding to the comments, Mthunzi Gumede, the mayor’s spokesperson, said: “While we are saying the city is clean, it is not without its challenges, hence the inner city rejuvenation plan to deal with bad buildings and to bring big businesses back to our city.” Daily News
