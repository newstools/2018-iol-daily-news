Durban - The new Sassa card should bring relief to grant beneficiaries across the country, the South African Security Social Agency said on Monday. The new card, which was made available at Post Offices around KwaZulu-Natal since Saturday, were designed to minimise illegal deductions and the only way beneficiaries can lose the money from their account is if they give their pin number away. Vusi Mahaye, Sassa provincial senior manager in marketing and communications said the new card was free. “Only funeral policies on non-child grants will be permitted and the policy premium should not exceed 10 % of the grant. Sassa will have to approve the policy first before a deduction can be allowed. Airtime purchasing, loans and electricity top-ups will not be approved. The cards works like a bank card,” Mahaye said. Beneficiaries can check their balance at any ATM, and the transaction will be for free. Here are some features of the new card that beneficiaries should look out for:   The old Sassa card will expire on September 30, 2018. Daily News
