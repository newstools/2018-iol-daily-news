Durban - Blue Security have retracted a press statement which claimed that a gang of hijackers who had fled the scene of a carjacking in Avoca returned to the scene after realising that they had a baby in the backseat of the car to give the baby back to its mother. The company in an updated statement on Tuesday said the hijackers "paused" before fleeing the scene. The hijackers allowed the mother to take the baby out of the vehicle before making off with car. The incident occurred in Parthab Road just before 7pm when four armed men hijacked a car with a mother and young child inside, Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said. “The gang arrived outside the property in a Silver Polo and hijacked a resident of her vehicle. But as they were about to flee the scene in the hijacked vehicle the mother of the baby screamed frantically that her child was still in the car. One of the suspects who had jumped into the back seat of the car handed the child to its mother,” Mathios said. “The hijackers then fled in the stolen vehicle which also contained the victim’s purse, keys and cellphone. A vehicle tracking firm later traced and recovered the vehicle,” Mathios said. Daily News
