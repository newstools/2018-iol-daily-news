Durban - A group of protestors from the Wentworth community gathered outside the entrance to Engen Refinery demanding jobs and more resources on Tuesday. Police had arrived on the scene in a bid to disperse the crowd. The protestors told the Daily News that they were frustrated with unemployment and a lack of education, health and rehabilitation resources being channelled to the Wentworth and other communities in the South Durban area. They’re particularly disgruntled with the Engen Refinery. Placards read: “The struggle is real - so wake up!” and “We want our Training Centre”, among others. Gavin Smith, Engen External Communications Manager, said they recognised and sympathised “with the plight of unemployed residents of South Durban, as well as those of our broader society”.
