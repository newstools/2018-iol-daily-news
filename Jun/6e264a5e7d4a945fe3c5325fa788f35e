Durban - The case of eight men who face charges of murder and attempted murder following violence at the Brook Street taxi rank in Durban two weeks ago has been adjourned in the Durban Magistrate's Court until next week. The men also face charges of defeating the ends of justice are  Bonisile Lili, Bhekisisa Mhlongo, Langelihle Bailey, Mandla Masango, Sehliselo Dladla, Phumlani Siyaya, Mazwi Nzama and Njabulo Cele. The Daily News earlier this year reported that police had arrested 16 people and recovered 17 firearms in the incident in which the men were allegedly involved. It’s alleged that the men who were heavily armed and travelling in a Quantum taxi stormed the taxi rank in Brook Street in Durban. They fired multiple shots and sped off. Three people were seriously injured and taken to hospital. One man, 56-year-old Mkhali Madondo died from his injuries police said. Madondo was believed to be one of the most powerful people in the province’s taxi industry. The men made their escape towards Pinetown where they were spotted by a police officer from the Pinetown task team. The police officer gave chase and the men fired multiple shots at him. He retaliated but no one was injured during the gunfight. The men then jumped out of the taxi and ran into a building in Pinetown. Members of the National Intervention Unit were called to the scene which resulted in the men being arrested. Violence monitor Mary de Haas said the violence in the province was becoming more brazen. She said many people within the industry were acting with impunity. “I am worried that things would get worse before they get better,” she said. It would take years before the violence in the industry got better, she said. De Haas said good crime intelligence and proactive policing was needed. She said that there was also an issue that politics was involved in the taxi industry. Daily News
