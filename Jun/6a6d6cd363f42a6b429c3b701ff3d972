Durban - A mature male dolphin died on Brighton Beach after suffering a broken lower jaw and wounds from the rocks on Sunday afternoon. According to a Facebook post by the KZN Marine Stranding Network, the dolphin was spotted by local residents and Brighton Beach lifeguards contacted the network. “Unfortunately, the dolphin died soon after members arrived,” the post said. “The animal has been retained for research.” In another incident, a sub-antarctic fur seal was seen in Southbroom, along the north coast of KZN. The seal was guarded through the night until it returned to the water. In another post, the network said the seal later returned to the beach close to where it had spent Friday evening. “Southbroom conservancy members and residents were up at sunrise to send pictures to the Network to verify the animal was still on the beach. Sea World and Ezemvelo collected the seal and he is now resting at Sea World after some fluids and antibiotics. He has a minor head injury and further assessments will be undertaken over the next couple of days,” the post said. Daily News
