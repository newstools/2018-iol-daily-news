In October, the 89-year-old Buthelezi announced that he would be stepping down from the position he has held for more than four decades, and he, along with the party’s national executive council, unanimously nominated Velenkosini Hlabisa as his successor. Hlabisa is the IFP’s provincial secretary in KwaZulu-Natal. Buthelezi vowed that he would not make himself available for leadership when the party sat for its elective conference, but it seems the party’s elective conference may only take place after next year’s national elections. The party’s national elective conference had been scheduled for December, but with branch auditing still continuing, the elective conference seems to be floating further and further away. The auditing of all branches was supposed to be wrapped up at end of last year but now the party’s chief whip, Narend Singh, said they were aiming for auditing to conclude at the end of this month. Initially, the conference was pencilled in for the first quarter of this year, but Singh said the conference could not take place until all auditing was completed. “The branches have until June 30 to complete the auditing,” Singh said yesterday. When asked about the likelihood of the party seeing a new face as its leader before the 2019 elections, Singh said: “I honestly just don’t know.” In December, he said the IFP first had to hold the KZN conference, then the National Youth Brigade conference and the National Women’s Brigade conference before its main elective conference.
