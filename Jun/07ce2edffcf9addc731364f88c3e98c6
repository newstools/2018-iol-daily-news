The amount would go to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) to continue impounding stray animals. The committee also resolved to propose a high-level meeting with the SPCA to engage on various issues affecting services provided by the organisation. According to a report tabled at Exco, a memorandum of agreement would be concluded with the Durban and Coastal SPCA for the next three years starting from July 1 to June 30, 2021. Exco heard that during the 2017/18 financial year, 12274 stray animals were collected, treated and taken care of by the SPCA. “The total cost to appropriately deal with the stray animals for one year is approximately R12.3million. eThekwini currently provides funding at a rate of approximately R217.62 per stray admitted to the SPCA’s pound for a period of seven days. This rate covers 22% of the actual costs borne by the society on behalf of the city. To make up the shortfall in funding, the SPCA relies on donations and other fundraising income from the public, including bequests,” reads the council’s report. Based on the current economic climate, donations from the public were diminishing, and there was an increased risk to the city if strays were not timeously attended to by the society, reads the report. It further stated that units within the municipality did not have the specialised resources, skills and expertise in the administration of animal care, pound- and control-related services in the implementation of animal removal function. There were three SPCA branches serving eThekwini region: Amanzimtoti, Durban and Coast and Kloof and Highway. The DA acknowledged the need to support the SPCA, and said it would be short-sighted to think that the SPCA was doing the city a favour by collecting stray animals. DA councillor Heinz de Boer said services needed to be extended because as the city grew, so did the number of animals. Daily News
