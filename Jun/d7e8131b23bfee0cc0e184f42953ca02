Durban - Local construction projects are likely to experience more disruptions from by Federation for Radical Economic Transformation (FFRET) - with Durban businessman Vivian Reddy one of their main targets, they said. On Thursday, the federation called an urgent media briefing to outline their planned interruption following what they termed lack of cooperation from big businesses involved in the projects. Zazi Nxele, the federation spokesperson, said in their first summit on radical economic transformation (RET) held last year, a resolution was taken to engage different public and private sector stakeholders. “After realizing that some parties are reluctant to come to the table, (FFRET) executive has resolved to take matters into their own hands. The federation has decided to take radical plans and programmes to address this continuous deliberate halting of RET by some stakeholders including some dominant sectors,” Nxele said. According to the federation Reddy is one of the targeted stakeholders. His multibillion-rand Oceans Umhlanga development has been disrupted several times this year leading to the business obtaining court interdicts against the federation. At the time of the disruption on April, Reddy had claimed that his company had donated R75 000 towards the federation’s radical economic transformation conference and that the project has a 50% black economic empowerment (BEE) participation including the professional team.
