Kwazi Mthethwa, department spokesperson, said after allegations surfaced of sexual assault and teachers allegedly having romantic relationships with pupils at the historic Adams College in eManzimtoti, the department had stepped up efforts to nip these problems in the bud. The allegations first surfaced on social media last week when some of the alleged victims posted messages on Twitter using the #AdamsCollege hashtag. Some alleged that male teachers were sleeping with pupils, one claimed that a teacher who had impregnated her had forced her to terminate the pregnancy in 2014. “Dlungwana has been looking at ways to ensure that such cases get reported. One of the ways he believes is to ensure that the cases are reported anonymously and directly to him. That would help protect both the pupils and whistle-blowers,” Mthethwa said. “The message we want to send out is that sexual assault and teachers having sexual relationships with pupils will not be tolerated at our schools.” Mthethwa urged pupils to report incidents. He said the department was aware of principals who tried to resolve matters internally, to keep the good name of the school. Attempts by the Daily News to get comment from the school governing body chairperson at Adams College were unsuccessful. The school referred media enquiries to the department. IFP spokesperson on Education Thembeni Madlopha­-Mthethwa said she met Dlungwana last week and discussed the issue of Adams College. “We are happy that the allegations are being investigated. We are aware of the procedures involved in investigating sensitive allegations.” She said the IFP would monitor the issue to ensure that investigations were done thoroughly. “Sex perverts have no place in the education profession. They must be named and shamed,” she said. Daily News
