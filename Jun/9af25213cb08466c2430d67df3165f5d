Durban - eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede has condemned the spate of land invasion and destruction of municipal property during recent protests around the city. Addressing an executive committee meeting sitting at the city hall on Tuesday, Gumede said some communities were living in fear and were worried if land invaders would target pieces of land near them. "If need be, we will go to court because we can't be living in a banana republic. We cannot afford to have private and public properties being destroyed as if we are fighting against the apartheid system. The burning of municipal buses and cars is wrong. The invasion of public and private land is also counterproductive," Gumede said. The Mercury reported on Monday that Durban communities and security firms clashed with land invaders on at least two pieces of land at the weekend. In Chatsworth, tensions were high on Sunday as invaders from uMlazi continued to clear land in the Silverglen Nature Reserve to construct new homes. And in Sherwood, residents protested on Saturday after land invaders began clearing land near Piedmont Road. The invaders in Silverglen, according to The Mercury, accused security guards of violent behaviour following another round of clashes between the two groups over the weekend. Guards attached to the eThekwini anti-land invasion unit were trying to stop the community which is intent on marking plots in the reserve. Although community members mainly from the C and H sections of uMlazi, started marking plots last month, they are yet to put up any physical structures. "We are busy discussing our Land Policy and others are being encouraged to occupy private and public land. Such actions are self-defeating and counter revolutionary," Gumede said. "The illegal occupation of land and land grab will deprive the rightful owners of land and also disrupt plans of development. Some areas that are being occupied have been identified for human settlement and schools," she said. Daily News
