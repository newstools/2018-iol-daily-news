Michael Williams said he ran the race last year while sick and was able to finish it in eight hours and 15 minutes. Williams said this year’s run was difficult and he believed the longer route could have played a role. Williams, who donned a multicoloured wig for the down run, said he wanted this year to be about having fun, and said there were many people along the route who commented that he stood out from the other runners. The 46-year-old said no two races were the same and each came with its own challenges. Age was also becoming a challenge for him, but this did not deter him. What carried him through was the support he received from people along the route. He said this spirit was what helped him overcome any obstacles he faced on the day. “If it was not for those people, I don’t think anyone would make it,” he said. Williams, who works as a technician at Steve Biko Academic Hospital, said he went all out for Comrades and gave it his best. The father of four, who has been married for 10 years, said he had been supported by his family. He had to sacrifice weekends to run and did not spend time with them. Williams began running because he had stopped smoking. He started with 5km runs and then joined a running club. “In 2012, my club suggested that I start running the Comrades,” he said. Williams has never looked back. “I ran the Comrades and I feel very proud,” he said. He finished the race in 7hours and 55minutes. Daily News
