Bryan Hellon said running the Comrades Marathon had long been a goal of his. The 32-year-old from La Lucia said the idea to raise funds for Isabella, from Johannesburg, came from the wife of his friend, Byron Leggett. Hellon said the money raised would give her an opportunity to communicate better with her family. Cerebral palsy has impaired Isabella’s vision and movement, which has resulted in her having to rely on others to move and communicate. The campaign aims to raise R60 000 to go towards buying an eye tracker, a computer and grid system, among other equipment. “She’s a beautiful girl and extremely smart. It will give her a way to communicate and give her an opportunity of a good life,” Hellon said. Legget said: “This device will give Izzy a sense of independence and finally she will have the ‘voice’ she has always longed for. She will finally be able to indicate when she’s tired and needs a nap. She will be able to affectionately argue with her brother. She will be able to form friendships and tell her parents that she loves them.” Hellon has been preparing for the run since January. “It’s going to be a tough day, but rewarding. Seeing the challenges Isabella faces has given me added impetus to finish the race.” Daily News
