Durban - Police swooped on members of a suspected gang of robbers dubbed the "Blue BM gang"  who are believed to be linked to robberies across Durban on Friday. On Wednesday messages and photos started doing the rounds among Community Policing Forum groups in Asherville, Somerset Park, Pinetown areas about a suspicious vehicle that was reported doing the rounds in these areas. According to reports the Blue BMW 3 Series was seen ferrying four to five male suspects, armed and at times wearing balaclavas. They were reported on the groups to be linked to home invasions, house robberies and hijackings in these areas. On Friday a picture was posted on one of the groups. It had seemingly been taken by a motorist who had spotted the vehicle this week: “This picture is being circulated. Was involved in an armed house robbery in the Bluff now. As per info. Matches above reg. Heading south (sic)” By midday another message appeared on another group relating to the same incident: “Vehicle caught awaiting updates now. SAPS Wentworth will have the vehicle impounded. Suspects going in now.” The Daily News followed the matter up with police. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed that the suspects had been caught on Friday. "Two suspects were arrested this morning at Wentworth for possession of suspected stolen property. The suspects aged 24 and 28 were arrested while driving a blue BMW." She said a preliminary investigation was conducted and revealed that the vehicle was hijacked in Wentworth earlier this month. "Nothing was found inside the vehicle. The suspects will be profiled to check if the suspects are linked to any other cases reported in Wentworth and surrounding areas," said Mbele. The suspects are expected to appear in the Wentworth Magistrates’ Court on Monday on charges of possession of a stolen property. Daily News
