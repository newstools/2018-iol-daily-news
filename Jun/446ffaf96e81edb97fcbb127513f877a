Durban - Forced removal of informal dwellers at Barcelona 2 informal settlement by eThekwini municipal anti-land invasion unit has prompted an urgent court interdict by Abahlali Basemjondolo. The group has on numerous occasions interdicted the municipality to only have those interdicts contravened. On Monday, Abahlali spokesperson Thapelo Mohapi, said the city evicted more people from in the Lamontville based Barcelona 2. “We are approaching the Durban High Court on an urgent basis to apply for a Spoliation Order against the eThekwini Municipality. On Friday at about 10 am the city violently and unlawfully evicted the residents from the disgraceful ‘transit camps’ that were forcefully imposed on them seven years ago in preparation for the FIFA World Cup. The method the city uses to evict these people is dangerous and it tears apart all the gains made by democracy,” Mohapi said. He said the city evicts people and bring in a group of its choice to occupy the gaps left by the evicted, which poses a very high risk of “serious conflict”. “We call on all traditional leaders to condemn the conduct of the city in the strongest terms and to reject this attempt to divide the people.  We note with serious concern that this municipality has never at any stage conducted any eviction in terms of the law. In other cities, court orders are obtained before an eviction. However, the eThekwini Municipality is a rogue municipality that operates without regard for the law year after year,” Mohapi said. The city had not responded to emailed questions by the time of going for publication. Daily News
