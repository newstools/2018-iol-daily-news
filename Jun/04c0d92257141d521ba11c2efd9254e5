Durban - Protesting truck drivers blocked off the N3 toll route in both directions at Van Reenen's Pass on Wednesday causing a backlog of about 8km according to traffic officials. KwaZulu-Natal Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson, Zinhle Mngomezulu, said they are still trying to figure out why the drivers are protesting. "The drivers have just parked their trucks off and they are obscuring all lanes on the N3 at Van Reenen's Pass. As a result, we've taken a decision to close off Tugela Plaza entirely as it would not make sense to allow vehicles through only for them to become stuck in the blockade. We have diverted traffic before Bergville," Mngomezulu said. Social media reports from trucking companies suggest the protests are a result of South African truckers being angry about the employment of foreign drivers in the industry. Members of the SA Police Service and members of Public Order Police are on the scene as well. It was unclear on Wednesday morning how long it will take to clear the trucks off the road. It's been reported that around 100 trucks have parked off on the roadway between Harrismith and the Tugela Toll Plaza / Ladysmith with seemingly no intentions on moving. "We are hoping that the drivers will move their vehicles and it doesn't get to a point where we have to bring in towing equipment to have them removed. We are urging members of the public to please use alternate routes," said Mngomezulu. In a statementÂ N3 Toll Concession (N3TC) - the company managing the N3 Toll Route between Cedara in KwaZulu-Natal and Heidelberg in Gauteng - advised motorists to avoid travel to this area. They said should it be essential to depart while the situation is not yet resolved, the following routes can be considered as alternatives:
