Durban - Police raided another building meant to house police officers that had been sub-letted to non-police officers by corrupt officials. Police officers from the Public Order Police, National Intervention Unit, Tactical Response Team, Flying Squad, K9 and DPCI swooped into the living quarters of Excelsior Court on the Berea during the early hours of Monday. Police officers searched room by room in the building and arrested 26 trespassers. Twenty-one of those arrested and could not provide a reasonable explanation for being on the premises, police spokesman, Brigadier Jay Naicker said. This comes after police raided another building intended for police accommodation on Friday night, where they arrested 115 people for trespassing.   All those arrested during Monday's raid were charged for trespassing and were served with an R300 admission of guilt fine. Police also made a discovery of 250g of heroin with an estimated street value of over R40 000 as well as 84 counterfeit DVD’s. "These items were found abandoned with nobody to account for them," Naicker said. Two of the illegal occupants arrested co-operated and told the police that they were paying rent. It was not clear who they were paying rent to were charged with trespassing. Acting Provincial Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, said: “It has become apparent over some time that officers have been illegally accommodating people who do not work for the South African Police Service. This has resulted in these buildings being in a state of dilapidation and not fit for human habitation. The fact that people are on our police premises illegally also poses a risk to the officers who live there,” he added. Two cases of corruption are currently being investigated. Daily News
