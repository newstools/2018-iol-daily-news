Durban - Emergency crews from various parts of KwaZulu-Natal rushed to the scene of a crash of a light aircraft in near Dargle in the KZN Midlands after the pilot crashed into the side of a hill on Monday. Robert McKenzie, spokesperson for KZN Emergency Medical Service said paramedicsÂ and rescuers, assisted by local farmers, had to climb down the steep and rocky hill to access the aircraft. "Paramedics worked together to treat the critically injured pilot, of the single-seat aircraft," Mckenzie said. He said paramedics had to use the Jaws of Life to pry open the plane and reached the trapped pilot. No one else was in the plane with him. Russel Meiring, spokesperson for ER24 said the pilot was a man in his 40's and was in a critical condition when paramedics arrived. "Rescue medics carefully extricated the man and assessed him, finding that he was in a critical condition, having sustained numerous injuries. Paramedics treated the man and provided him with advanced life support interventions before he was airlifted by the IPSS Medical Helicopter to Mediclinic Pietermaritzburg for urgent treatment. The details surrounding this incident are not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations," he said. Daily News
