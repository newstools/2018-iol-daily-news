Clive Gibson Cole appeared on Thursday in the Durban Commercial Crimes Court. It is alleged that in 2014, Cole claimed for hailstorm damage to crops on his farm and on land he had leased to a neighbouring farmer. During testimony, Cole’s neighbour Mark Wilmott said the accused had initially asked him to take a joint insurance policy. Wilmott said Cole told him that this would help them both to have lower rates. Wilmott was farming maize and Cole cabbages, and each would pay for their crop but “it turned out to be a non-event”, he said. The State argued that Cole did not inform the insurance company that the maize did not belong to him. Wilmott later found out through a third party that Cole had received a huge payout from Mutual and Federal. He said he did not know that Cole had claimed for damage to the maize on property that he had leased. A representative from Mutual and Federal who identified himself as Willie Fouche had visited Wilmott who took him on a tour of the properties. Fouche then told him that some of his maize had been insured by Cole. “I was shocked as it was my maize on my farm,” he said. Wilmott said Fouche then requested an affidavit to state on whose property the maize was. He said his attorney helped him to draw it up. Wilmott then confronted Cole who did not deny the claim. While this was happening, Wilmott said he was also cognisant of the fact that he was leasing land from Cole. The matter was adjourned to July 25. Daily News
