Durban - A Chatsworth family are reeling from shock after they were forced out of their vehicle at gunpoint by hijackers allegedly dressed as policemen. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said the complainant and his family members were seated in their silver Toyota Corolla along Silvermount Road on Sunday. "They noticed an unknown vehicle drive pass them. The driver of the vehicle made a  U-turn and stopped next to their vehicle. Four unknown suspects alighted from their vehicle pointed them with firearms and instructed them to get out of the vehicle," Zwane said. A close source to the family and a member of the Moorton Neighbourhood Watch said two of the men were wearing police uniforms. Zwane did not confirm this. A case of carjacking is being investigated by Chatsworth SAPS.
