“Nkuleko Mkhize” had posted that “Indians in KwaZulu-Natal should go back to India. If they did not go back to India then they would die like Sadia Sukhraj did”. The post, which went viral, was made when Chatsworth residents were furious over the death of 9-year-old Sadia, who was killed in a botched hijacking. After the comments were posted, ANC activist Visvin Reddy opened a case of crimen injuria. Ashwin Trikamjee, the president of the South African Hindu Maha Sabha, made a complaint to the South African Human Rights Commission. “Nkuleko Mkhize’s” Facebook account has subsequently been deleted. Nkululeko Mkhize said he started receiving messages soon after the post went viral. He said people had called him the K-word while others swore at him and accused him of being unsympathetic. The Pietermaritzburg pupil also found a spike in his Facebook friend requests. “I felt bad because I am not a racist. I just wanted to say that I am not the person who made the message,” he said. Mkhize said he had to change his name on his Facebook account to stop the hateful messages and also considered leaving the social media platform, which his worried mother has advised him to do. “My name is being dragged through the mud,” he said. The youngster also posted a statement denying he made the remarks. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said there had been no arrests made in connection with the incident and that investigations were ongoing. Daily News
