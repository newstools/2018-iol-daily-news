Subramoney, 26, will meet compatriot Justice Siliga in a World Boxing Association (WBA) Pan African elimination heavyweight fight over six rounds. If he wins he will get a crack at the WBA Pan African heavyweight title on Fox Sports’ next tournament. “I’m looking forward to the biggest challenge of my career,” the 110kg heavyweight said at the Chatsworth Boxing Academy last night. “It’s a big opportunity for me and I’d like to thank the promoters for having faith in my abilities. I’ve worked hard since signing contracts with Fox Sports Africa Boxing and will do my best to get to the next step - the WBA Pan African title fight.” Never before has the South African Indian community produced a boxer in the heavyweight division. There were many in the lighter divisions, the most famous being the late Seaman Chetty, who won the South African (non-white) flyweight and bantamweight titles in 1936 and 1939. The last Indian professional boxer to have fought regularly when boxing was on a high in KwaZulu-Natal was featherweight Nagoor Govender, who fought from late 1957 to early 1971 - his record was 19 wins, 22 losses and 4 draws. Another was lightweight Johnny Latchmanna, from 1978 to 1981. Stan Christodoulou, the WBA development officer for Africa, confirmed that Subramoney was the first Indian professional heavyweight fighter to feature on an international bill. “We’ve been through the records and cannot find another heavyweight from his community. “He’s strong but well-built. I watched some of his videos and I was blown away by his approach. He has a lot of power in his punches. He has the potential to go all the way provided he is well handled.” Subramoney has fought seven times, recording five wins, a loss and a draw. He has three knockouts to his name. All his fights have been in small arenas. Now he steps up to showcase his ability as Fox Sports will televise the fight to 22 African countries - and the whole of Europe. Daily News
