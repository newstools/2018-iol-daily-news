Durban - All lanes of the N3 Freeway between Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal have been opened to traffic following a blockade by truck drivers on Wednesday that ground traffic to a halt around Van Reenen's pass. The N3 Toll Concession (N3TC) - the company managing the N3 Toll Route between Cedara in KwaZulu-Natal and Heidelberg in Gauteng - said that both north- and southbound lanes had been re-opened to traffic again at Van Reenen’s Pass between Harrismith and Tugela Plaza/Ladysmith on Thursday morning. Between 60 and 70 trucks had to be towed away after protestors blocked the national route at Van Reenen, the company said. "Heavy vehicles were stacked over at least a 10km distance in both directions of the N3 Toll Route in the vicinity of Van Reenen. Large volumes of traffic were also diverted away from this area. Emergency services cleared the northbound section for traffic last night; and re-opened the southbound lanes this morning," a statement from N3TC said. Con Roux, commercial manager at N3TC said: "We expect busy traffic conditions today as the backlog of traffic continues to be cleared; and request both truckers and motorists to be extra cautious and patient,” It comes after police said that 62 protesting truck drivers were arrested for freeway blockade. The drivers were charged with public violence and obstructing traffic and were expected to appear in court soon, police spokesperson, Thembeka Mbele said on Thursday. Authorities worked through the night and even called in towing operations to remove dozens of trucks that blocked the N3 at Van Reenen’s Pass on Wednesday following a truck driver’s protest. Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson Zinhle Mngomezulu said some of the drivers who blockaded the freeway were arrested, while others simply abandoned their trucks. Daily News
