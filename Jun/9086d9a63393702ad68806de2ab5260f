The Department of Education said its winter vacation revision programme, devised to assist the matric class of 2018, is ready to roll out at identified schools. Spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi said: “Our target is specifically aimed at poorly-performing schools which have progressed and struggling pupils. “There are around 1 700 high schools in the province. But the Winter School Programme will only run at those that have been identified as being in need of the programme.” The programme will run from June 25 to July 13 and covers 14 subjects. These include maths, maths literacy, geography, accounting, economics, physical sciences, technical mathematics,technical sciences and history. Pupils are also required to write a pre-test at the beginning of the programme and a test at the end, to evaluate their progress. Mahlambi said the schools are primarily in charge of managing the programme. “Some schools will compress the programme into one week; others who are struggling will take two weeks and allow the children to rest in the last week of the winter holiday.” However, the programme will be led and or assisted by those teachers identified by the department to have proven, exemplary results. “Teachers who have achieved a 75% pass rate and above in their schools have been identified to lead and assist in the winter programmes. “In addition, our officials from head office, district offices and circuit level managers will be monitoring that these programmes are carried out,” said Mahlambi. Mahlambi said that in addition to winter school, they have instituted other programmes to help struggling schools, such as holding classes on Saturdays. Daily News
