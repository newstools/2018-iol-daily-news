Hundreds gathered closer to the field to watch the horses cross the finish line. Dr Phumla Mnganga, Gold Circle’s chief executive, expressed her gratitude to the Daily News for the fruitful relationship. She said the day’s race was fantastic and commended the pleasant weather. “The quality of racing was great and we really look forward to what this means for the Vodacom Durban July,” she said. Daily News editor Aakash Bramdeo delivered a vote of thanks and congratulated the winners. “I would like to thank Gold Circle for a long-standing relationship. I would also like to congratulate the winners and extend a special thanks to supporters of Gold Circle and the Daily News,” said Bramdeo. Ian van Schalkwyk, owner of the winning horse, could not contain his excitement as he held the Daily News 2000 trophy. “I am over the moon for this win. I feel like a proud father,” he said. Horse trainer Stuart Pettigrew said the six months’ of preparation for the race was well worth it. Wrogemann said, “I have been in the industry since 1982. I have been in the game for a very long time and it is always good to win these big races,” he said. Having turned 50 this year, Wrogemann said winning the Daily News 2000 was a phenomenal race for anyone to win. “I was just a pilot. Mr Pettigrew and his whole team made sure the horse was where it needed to be to win the race,” said Wrogemann. He said it was unfortunate that Surcharge would not be competing for the rest of the season, or race in the Vodacom Durban July, as he needed to rest - but Wrogemann was very proud of how far the horse had come.
