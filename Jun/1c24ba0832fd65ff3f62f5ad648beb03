The meeting, which was preceded by the first state of the city address, had a rather bumpy start when the EFF staged a walkout after their point-of-order call was suppressed by council speaker William Mapena. The party wanted Mapena to accommodate their motion of no confidence in Gumede, which they filed in her office on Wednesday. Mapena said he had ruled on the matter and then signalled for Gumede to proceed with her speech. During her address in which the city’s R38.7billion budget for 2018/19 was adopted, Gumede said project stoppages, which was one of the challenges the city faced, would not be tolerated. “Some of these forums receive information from our officials and from some of the contractors and collude to inflate project prices. Stoppage of work in projects around the city is not acceptable and will not be tolerated,” she said. The Daily News understands there is an investigation into the alleged collusion and some individuals involved have since been identified. Mthunzi Gumede, the mayor’s spokesperson, confirmed there was an ongoing investigation into the matter. He said it was through internal sources that the forums got to know about internal matters, including hearings against individuals. “How did they know that there was a disciplinary hearing taking place? “How did they know all the municipal-awarded projects around the city and who was awarded those projects?” he asked. In March, the Daily News reported that the Delangokubona Business Forum, whose members are affiliates of the Federation for Radical Economic Transformation, had stormed the city’s legal services offices at the embassy building in Anton Lembede (Smith) Street, disrupting a disciplinary hearing against Zandile Sithole, the suspended deputy head of supply chain management. They had demanded Sithole’s re-instatement because they viewed her as a champion of economic transformation. Daily News
