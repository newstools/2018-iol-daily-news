"The month began with the rand at around R12.65 to the dollar, but the average currently stands at nearly R13.30. Fortunately, international oil prices have retreated at a similar rate, resulting in a fairly moderate fuel price increase outlook for July," the AA said in a statement. International petroleum prices and the rand strengthened against the US dollar, are the two primary factors which influence the fuel price on a monthly basis. Layton Beard,  AA spokesperson said: “We are expecting the price increase to be at least 22c”.  The price of fuel usually in increases on the first Wednesday of the month.  It was reported in early June that motorists would have to pay more than R15 a litre. This was after early estimates put the price of fuel to increase by 82c a litre.  Given the increased cost of fuel in South Africa, the AA has urged the government to reconsider the high cost added to taxes which account for up to one third of the petrol price.  The AA said that currently R5.30 of every litre of petrol is paid towards the General Fuel Levy and the Road Accident Fund Levy. "Combined with lower wage hikes and the increasing cost of living, the expenses of commuting by private car might spiral beyond many motorists' reach  commuters who would have never previously have considered public transport or carpooling may soon have no option," the association said.
