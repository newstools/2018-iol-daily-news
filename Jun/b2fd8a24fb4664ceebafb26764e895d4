Durban- The Comrades Marathon 2018 promises to be another spectacle with a slight deviation of the route. The 93rd marathon between the cities of Pietermaritzburg and Durban will take place on Sunday starting at 05h30. The race will end at the Moses Mabhida Stadium for the first time. Previous races ended at the Kingsmead Cricket Stadium on the down run. Comrades Marathon Origins The first Comrades Marathon was run on Empire Day, 24 May 1921, when 34 runners lined up before the Pietermaritzburg City Hall to commence a race to Durban to commemorate the spirit and camaraderie of the soldiers who fought in the Great War. It owes its origins to the tireless efforts of its founder Vic Clapham (war veteran & SA Railways engine driver) whose vision it was to create a living memorial to the spirit of his “comrades” who suffered so greatly in the war. The first race was run on old dust roads, with the runners having to pass through several gates and at least one stream.
