Durban - The atmosphere was tense near RK Khan Regional Hospital in Chatsworth when Metro police, SAPS and tactical response team impounded more than 40 minibus taxis belonging to St Wendolins Taxi Association. Two associations, KwaSanti and Chatsworth Taxi Association are on the warpath over operating routes. On Thursday morning police from different units diffused what could have been a full out gun battle between the warring parties. The KwaSani Association alleges that their Chatsworth counterparts were pushing them out of business. Sbusiso Mfeka, an additional committee member of the KwaSanti Association said the bone of contention was a taxi rank which they have been using for about 20 years now. “We have been operating from this rank for about 20 years. A few months ago the Chatsworth association blocked us from using this rank, claiming that we had no permit to do so. We obliged but they still left the rank while we had to drop our passengers, who are mostly patients or people visiting their loved ones in the hospital, on the freeway, about 500 meters from the hospital. These people have to walk the remainder of the trip to the hospital,” Mfeka said. He said when they returned to the rank, which is a stone throw from RK Khan, security for the Chatsworth association shot at them, injuring one driver while another one was assaulted with an assortment of items including a golf stick and cricket bat. “Both men are in the hospital and the police have taken our vehicles. Vehicles belonging to the Chatsworth operators were not touched and they are still operating from their rank right in front of the hospital,” he said. Attempts to get comment from the Chatsworth association were unsuccessful and the exact number of arrests and impounded minibus taxis is not known at this stage. Chatsworth police said they diffused the situation before it could get worse. A statement detailing the arrests and impounds will be released later in the day. Daily News
