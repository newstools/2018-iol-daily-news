Durban- A motorist stabbed two robbers who allegedly tried to hijack him of his car in Mobeni Heights, Chatsworth. Captain Nqobile Gwala, KwaZulu Natal police spokesperson, said the 25-year-old motorist was seated in his car on Magnolia Street on Sunday when two robbers walked up to him. The men had been brandishing knives and threatened him. "They took his car keys from the ignition. The motorist managed to disarm one of the men of his knife. He stabbed both of them," Gwala said. An attempted hijacking was opened at Bayview police station for investigation. Gwala said the two robbers were taken to hospital for medical attention. They were under police guard. Dianne Kohler Barnard, a DA MP who sits on the Police Portfolio Committee, said to be confronted by aggressive strangers is every South African’s worst nightmare.  She said South Africans have had enough. "We live today behind every bar, beam and wall we can afford.  It is easy to tell citizens not to do anything, to look at the floor and give robbers whatever they want. I know from experience when I was attacked by two men who jumped from a Mercedes outside my front door.  I fought back in a red-fog fury.  I saved my car and home, but lost my handbag," she said. "The rage that surges through them when their treasured possessions are stolen, and they are threatened is today so enormous it wipes out the instinctive fear in the face of attack," Kohler Barnard said.
