Durban - Mxolisi Kaunda, KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, said the South African National Defence force would not be called to address the crime in Chatsworth. Kaunda was responding to calls in the community for the army to step in. This comes after Kaunda visited the Chatsworth community after the killing of Sadia Sukhraj, 9-year-old, during a botched hijacking on Monday. He said it was only the president who could call in the army and the situation had not reached that point in Chatsworth. He also called for criminals to be severely dealt with and wanted harsher sentences. "We must suffocate these criminals to exist in society," he said. After news broke of the death of Sadia, the MEC urged the Shallcross community to declare war on crime. He said the best way of paying tribute to Sadia would be to unite and declare war on all forms of crime in the province. Daily News
