“We will be sending ANC NEC members to branches in KZN. The provincial conference will continue. Killings are killings. It is a criminal thing, not political,” he explained. The conference will also go ahead despite party members from three regions calling for a postponement, claiming they were being barred from branch meetings and were not allowed to be registered as members in good standing. The disgruntled ANC members had also argued that the province was “unstable” as a result of the killings of politicians. Giving the conference the green light at a post-national executive committee (NEC) briefing on Tuesday, Magashule said the party was “happy and satisfied with KZN”. “Eight out of 11 regions are in good standing. Moses Mabhida, Lower South Coast and Harry Gwala (regions) have raised issues of gatekeeping and we are listening to their disputes through the national dispute resolution committee. The conference will go ahead as it is made up of branches, and not regions,” Magashule said. He said the conference would be overseen by party representatives including deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte. “We urge all regional and provincial structures to convene their conferences and conduct them in a spirit of inclusion and to complete them before the end of July,” Magashule added. Magashule formally suspended the provincial leadership and replaced it with an interim structure convened by former KZN economic development and tourism MEC Mike Mabuyakhulu and co-ordinated by his predecessor and former ANC provincial chairperson Sihle Zikalala. This after the Pietermaritzburg High Court found that the 2015 elective conference, won by Zikalala against Senzo Mchunu, was null and void. Daily News
