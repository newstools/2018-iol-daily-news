Integrity Idol is a campaign run in Nepal, Liberia, Pakistan, Mali, Nigeria and South Africa by citizens in search of honest government officials and aims to generate debate around the idea of integrity and honesty with the hope of inspiring a new generation of effective public servants. Volunteers gather nominations from citizens, host public forums and generate a national discourse on the need for public officials with integrity. The nominees were narrowed down to a final five in each country. Pillay was nominated for going beyond the call of duty to help the aged, disabled and others in need in his community. He was in the finals with Elizabeth Mkhondo, a nurse from Mamelodi; team entry Deon Easu and Jocelin Flank, firefighters from Johannesburg; Mirja Delport, an Oudtshoorn doctor; and Natascha Meisler, a teacher from the Free State.
