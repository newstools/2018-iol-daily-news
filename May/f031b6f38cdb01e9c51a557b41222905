The Daily News earlier reported that all pupils in three grades at the school had failed their first term exams because they’d had no teachers since the beginning of the year. Now, the SGB has decided to appoint two Grade R teachers to teach two classes that had no teachers last term. SGB treasurer Elizabeth Nhlumayo said Education Department officials had visited the school days after the parents had protested outside the gate, and had done a headcount of the pupils, which proved that there was overcrowding. However, they had not heard anything from the department since then regarding the appointment of extra teachers. “We have sent a letter to the department telling them that we are choosing to appoint these teachers because they are qualified for the job,” 
said Nhlumayo. “We cannot just wait for the department to bring their teachers because we do not know how long that will take,” said Nhlumayo. She said the school had had a tough year so far. Nhlumayo said two pupils had died in car accidents and two of illness. Principal Ntombi Madlala was pleased the department had established that the school was overcrowded. “We have pupils coming in to apply almost every day. “Parents in the surrounding areas love this school because it is a no-fee school; it accommodates everyone,” she said. Madlala said two teachers who had been off sick during the first term had returned, taking the total to 24. “There are more than 1 000 pupils and we need more than 24 teachers to attend to those pupils,” she said. Education Department spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa said officials were working “round-the-clock” to ensure that teachers were sent to the school. Mthethwa added that many schools in the province were overcrowded and the department was trying to attend to the matter. Daily News
