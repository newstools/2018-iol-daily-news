“I had spoken to him just five minutes before he took off. I still checked that he had his navigation equipment and that he had the correct info on GPS. It is still a shock,” said Karl Jensen. Jensen is a member of the Experimental Aircraft Association of SA (EAA of SA), an ex-airline pilot and a close friend of Claus Keuchel and Maxine Frisch who died in the crash. The association had held a convention in Vryheid from Friday to Sunday which Keuchel and Frisch had attended. After the convention closed, the pilots’ departure from Vryheid airfield was delayed initially because of overcast weather. Jensen said Keuchel was able to leave the airfield about 1pm. “We have a network where we advise each other of our planned trips and check in when we’ve arrived. By that evening Claus was the only one outstanding on the group. “I sent him a WhatsApp message. By around 5am on Monday I realised that his message had still not been read. We tried calling his home (in Alberton, Gauteng) but we couldn’t get through. We managed to reach someone to go to the Vereeniging airfield to check on his hangar. By about 9am they confirmed his hanger was empty and only his car was parked there,” said Jensen. The association then contacted the Aviation Rescue Co-ordination Centre and an operation centre was set up in Vryheid. “While I was making my way to the ops centre, I was informed that a local farmer had received a call to say a plane had crashed on his farm. It appears Claus was on track for his trip from Vryheid to Vereeniging, but for some reason he flew straight into the mountain,” said Jensen. “Accidents do happen, but it is still a shock for us,” he said. South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) spokesperson Kabelo Ledwaba said the cause of an accident could only be pronounced through the release of a final accident investigation report.
