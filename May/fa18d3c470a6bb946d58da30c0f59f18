The city has experienced disruptions in waste removal, and last week officials at the DSW headquarters were reportedly held hostage by contractors. A report tabled at the executive committee (Exco) meeting on Tuesday detailed that last year contractors were granted waste removal work for three months at a cost of R45 million. According to the report, the award was approved on December 18, but an approval was made for six months without adjusting the cost accordingly. The city had experienced service protests in the southern, northern and central parts which contributed to the high cost of illegal dumping services, read the report. “The approved R45 million (excluding vat) budget was based on a three-month contract, and therefore an adjustment to align the contract to six months was required, meaning that the R45 million has to be adjusted to R130 million. “The funds required are not provided for in the current budget of the unit and savings amounting to R34.4 million have been identified. There are no savings from which the balance of R95.6 million can be obtained,” the report said. Exco recommended that authority be granted to increase the budget to the required amount for the six-month period ending next month. Last week, The Mercury - sister newspaper of the Daily News - reported that officials were held against their will in their offices, allegedly by armed men ­demanding payments owed to contractors and sub-contractors. The DA did not support the report. Noluthando Magewu, acting head of cleaning and solid waste, said the requested amount would resolve the issue. “We are not requesting an additional R130 million, but we are requesting an amendment to the contract value for the same period.” Daily News
