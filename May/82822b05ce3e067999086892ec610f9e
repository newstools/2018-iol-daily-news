Durban - Connie September, parliament chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and Training  to higher education institutions to tighten security around to ramp up security and access controls at all campuses in the aftermath of the murder of Mangosuthu University of Technology student, Zolile Khumalo last week. Khumalo was killed at the university's Lonsdale Hotel residence last week. In a statement, she said security measures at student residences needed to be beefed up as the new-found freedom students have when they go to tertiary institutions also unintentionally exposes them to being abused. “The committee sends its deepest condolences to the family of the deceased. We are extremely shocked and saddened that this tragedy happened on one of our campuses. Ms (Zolile) Khumalo did not deserve to die like this,” she said. She said the committee she chairs was interested in knowing who gave Khumalo’s killer access the building. “The university must investigate this incident, and make sure no stones would be left unturned...Murder of female students on campuses is despicable. These are the same students who are still battling rape culture and recognition in academia. A situation where campuses become places of torment should not be allowed,” September said.
