Durban - Anisa Khan, a witness to the events that unfolded at the Imam Hussain Mosque will never forget the tragedy that unfolded before her eyes. Khan was with Abbas Essop across the road from the Imam Hussain Mosque in Ottawa, Verulam when they heard screams for help from inside the property. "They came with the intention to kill. (Mosque staffer Mohamed) Ali thought they were coming to pray. (After opening the gates for them) he left them and carried on with his duties." Ali then heard loud bangs and, on investigating, was grabbed in a headlock. He managed to free himself and ran out into the yard, where he screamed for help, she said. "Abbas ran to help when he heard the screams; it was a natural reaction. They grabbed him in a headlock and put duct tape on his mouth. They slit his throat." Ali Nchinyane, the priest, heard the scuffle and came down with his nunchucks. However, the men disarmed him during the fight. Nchinyane ran back to his room upstairs, all the while fighting the men off. "The only way for him to survive was to get out. He decided to jump out of the window. He had cuts on his hands and neck," said Khan. She said the men told Nchinyane they were brainwashing people. They apparently told him that no literature must be left for them to teach with. The attackers then set the mosque library alight before fleeing. Firefighters prevented the fire from spreading and contained the blaze to one room. Essop - who ran to help -  had his throat slit during the attack and died a shortly after arriving at the hospital. Nchinyane, 28, who led the mosque in prayer was stabbed on his shoulders. He was discharged from hospital late on Thursday Ali had his stomach gutted by the attackers and was recovering in hospital. Police have launched a manhunt for the three attackers. No arrests have been made. Daily News
