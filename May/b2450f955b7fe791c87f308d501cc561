Durban -The man accused killing 9-year-old Sadia Sukhraj abandoned his bail application on Thursday. Sibonelo Mkhize appeared before the Durban Magistrates Court for the second time for the little girl’s death. Sadia was killed in a botched hijacking on Monday in Shallcross while on her way to school with her father, Pastor Shalendra Sukhraj. Sadia died while ón her way to a hospital, after a shootout between the hijackers and her father. She had been in her father’s SUV when she was shot. As the suspects fled the scene, one was killed and another was arrested, while a third suspect is still at large. Still, with a bruised face, Mkhize walked up the dock still wearing the clothes he wore on Wednesday when he made his first appearance. He told the court that he was assaulted again by police when he was taken to verify his address on Thursday. Magistrate Mohamed Motala began proceedings by issuing a warning about irresponsible comments and threats made by people out on social media, including the defense attorney who is representing Mkhize. “Such comments do not help the case in any way. The defence attorney is performing her duties and at the end of the day the law must take its course,” said Motala. The case was adjourned to July 18, for further investigation. Daily News
