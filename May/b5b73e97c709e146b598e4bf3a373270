Durban- Murdered Mangosuthu University of Technology Student Zolile Khumalo will be buried on Saturday at her home in Eshowe. This is according to Bheki Hlophe the spokesperson for the institution who said there had been inaccurate comments in the media that Khumalo was already buried. Hlophe also said there would be a press conference on Tuesday on the developments regarding the death of Khumalo. The Daily News reported last week that the institution planned to have a crisis meeting in the aftermath of Khumalo's death. The conference is to be held at MUT. She was killed last week at Lonsdale Hotel which is one of MUT’s residences. Her death resulted in a large outcry over her death. Thabani Mzolo, her ex-boyfriend, appeared in court for her murder. A smiling Mzolo pulled a trigger finger signal as he left the Durban Magistrates Court last week. He is due to appear later this week in relation to charges on her death. Khumalo’s death came just after Sandile Mantsoe was convicted and sentenced to 32 years in prison for the murder of Karabo Mokoena whom he killed and burned her body. Daily News
