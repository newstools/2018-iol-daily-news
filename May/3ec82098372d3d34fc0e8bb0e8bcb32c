Durban -Â Tyrone Pillay who was convicted of gunning down his ex-girlfriend, Annelene Pillay, has been sentenced to 25 years imprisonment term by the Durban High Court on Monday.  A video captured on CCTV of 26-year-old Annelene being shot by Tyrone as she exited her workplace on South Coast Road in November 2016 went viral on social media.  Tyrone, 33, who told the court that he had a ten-year-relationship with Annelene pleaded guilty and said his actions were the result of anger and a feeling of neglect after she stopped taking his calls and ignored him.  He said he had heard through someone that Annelene had moved on romantically which angered him.  He said in the guilty plea that he tried to communicate with her several times and tried to meet her in an attempt to get back together but she would not take his calls.
