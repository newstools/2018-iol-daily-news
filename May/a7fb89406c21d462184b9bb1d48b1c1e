Durban - The South African weather service has warned there will be heavy rains which may result in floods in large parts of the country over the next few days. “There is potential for some areas to receive significant amounts of rainfall from this weather system,” said the weather service. KwaZulu-Natal, the eastern part of North West, the northern and eastern Free State, Gauteng, Limpopo and Mpumalanga are provinces that would be affected by the thundershowers. The risk for heavy rain would be seen on Tuesday in Limpopo and KZN. “Conditions all around are set to improve from Thursday afternoon onwards, with a gradual recovery in daytime temperatures,” said the weather service. Cold weather can be expected in many parts of KZN for the next couple of days. Julius Mahlangu, weather forecaster at South African Weather Service, said there was a 30% chance of rain and thundershowers across the province. He said there would be a 60% chance of rain in the eastern parts of KZN which would include Pietermaritzburg and the coastline. “Low temperatures could result in a chance of light snow in the south western parts of KwaZulu-Natal,” said Mahlangu. In Durban, temperatures were expected to be low with a minimum of 15 and maximum of 21 on Tuesday and on Wednesday 60 to 80% of rain in the northern parts of KZN was expected.
