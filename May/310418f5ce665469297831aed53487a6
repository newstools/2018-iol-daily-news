Durban - Motorists should brace themselves for another mass fuel price hike in June, the Automobile Association (AA )has said.. The country is facing increases of 74 cents a litre for petrol, 81 cents for diesel, and 78 cents for paraffin. The AA has released their predictions following trends which indicate a likely increase. Their predictions have been gleaned from the unaudited mid-month fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund. AA spokesperson Layton Beard said last month's fuel price account was closed earlier by the Department of Energy, resulting in the postponement of a substantial 50 cent-per-litre increase, brought on by a weakening rand and rising international oil prices at the end of April. “The deferred loss from last month will be included in this month's adjustment, which is currently looking to be substantial," Beard said. "The country started May with a substantial fuel price deficit. In the first half of May, the fuel picture has continued to worsen, with steep oil price rises and ongoing weakness of the Rand against the US dollar,” he said. Beard said they were concerned about the impact of these price hikes would have on the economy. "Rises in the fuel price increases the cost of doing business, and companies have few options but to pass these costs on to consumers. Worryingly, people who use illuminating paraffin for lighting, heating and cooking will suffer a further blow as the country heads into winter," he said. Beard said the AA would issue a second prediction by next week. Changes to fuel prices kick in on the first Wednesday of the new month. Daily News
