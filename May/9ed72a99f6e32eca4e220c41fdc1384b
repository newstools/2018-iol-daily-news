The Child Welfare Durban and District (CWDD), which is in charge of the centre, did not respond to media requests for an update into the investigation. However, on Saturday, CWDD chairperson Rajan Pillay told the Sunday Tribune, sister newspaper of the Daily News, during the opening of the rebuilt cottage and a garden of remembrance, that the organisation did not receive the fire report, but was told the cause was accidental. King Goodwill Zwelithini, businessman Vivian Reddy and Social Development MEC Weziwe Thusi were present for the official opening. The cottage was rebuilt by Reddy’s Sibaya Community Trust at a cost of R2.5 million. After the fire in July 2016, at least one employee said they were warned against talking to the media about the incident. The police are not providing much information on the outcome of the investigation. Minenhle Ngcobo, 21; Sibongiseni Nxumalo, 18; John Shusha, 17; Sfundo Ndlovu, 17; Gabriel Mbambo, 11; Ajesh Gangerpasad, 9; Sandile Duma, 8; and Fikisani Chala, 8; died in the fire. On July 14, 2016, eThekwini Fire and Emergency Services Unit attended the scene, and on July 19 the city told the Daily News the unit had done its job, completed its investigation and submitted a report to the police. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, the provincial police spokesperson, said: “It was not established as to what was the cause of the fire. “The door of the building was locked as everybody was asleep since it was at night. The detective wanted to find out what was the cause of the fire and to find out whether anyone was negligent.” Anisha Moti, an employee at CWDD, last week confirmed receipt of e-mailed questions from the Daily News. She said she had referred the questions to the organisation’s directors and a response would only be available once the directors had replied. Daily News
