Durban - Three cable drums with hundreds of metres of cable, worth millions of rands, were confiscated from a Clairwood scrapyard by police. Cable theft is a serious crime that costs the City of eThekwini millions of rands each year said Durban Metro police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad. The cables are usually stripped and sold to scrap metal dealers or sold to unscrupulous people who connect electricity illegally. Metro Police in partnership with South African Police Services recovered electricity cables worth more than R1.5 million in a sting operation after receiving a tip-off. "One person was arrested. Two other suspects were taken in for questioning. Further investigations are being conducted. Metro Police commend the men for the quick action in apprehending suspects," Parboo said. A case of theft was opened at the Montclair Police Station. Mandla Nsele, eThekwini municipality spokesperson, said  South Africa is facing a major problem with copper theft and has a negative impact on all citizens. The estimated loss due to copper theft is approximately R5 billion per year with eThekwini electricity contributing R60 million to that loss. It has an impact on the City’s communication network, electricity supply, and railway and traffic services. "Copper cable holds a high monetary value and can be sold for R65-R70 per kilogram. The scrap metal business has become very lucrative with unscrupulous dealers simply buying copper with no questions asked. The stolen copper is then exported to other countries like China and India and the same copper is then procured by the country it has been stolen from,"Nsele said. The city appeals to the public to report cable theft to 031 311 9611 during office hours or to the nearest police station. Daily News
