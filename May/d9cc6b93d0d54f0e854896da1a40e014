In stage 5 kidney failure, Joshua died at the Netcare Sunward Hospital in Johannesburg. His mother, Natasha Singh, had taken him to Johannesburg to consult with a pastor. The Daily News had last month published the mother’s desperate plea for a kidney to save young Joshua’s life. A number of people had come forward and offered to be kidney donors, but the process of testing had taken too long. Read: Durban mom's plea for kidney “I had brought him to Johannesburg so that we could consult with a pastor on Friday and he was going to get his dialysis at the hospital over the weekend before returning to Durban on Monday. Unfortunately, my baby never got to return home,” said the distraught mom. She said he suddenly took a turn for the worst yesterday morning. “I am just waiting for an investigation so that we know what went wrong, then my baby and I will return home,” said Singh. Samantha Nicholls, the executive director at the Organ Donor Foundation (ODF), said testing for live kidney donations was normally done between family members or friends which meant the donor and recipient needed to know each other, which made the process difficult.  Singh expressed her appreciation to her ward councillor Pastor Patrick De Wet, the managing director of SMG Durban North Beach, Sean McCarthy and her family and friends for support. “I am grateful for all the support, but also I want to add that I lost a child who was waiting for an organ transplant,” said Singh. Nicholls encouraged the public to become organ donors by registering at www.odf.org.za or calling 0800 22 66 11. According to ODF’s 2016 report, about 35000 to 45000 people sign up to be organ donors annually, but only 100 end up donating each year. This is a low number for the estimated 4300 South Africans who desperately need transplants. Singh said funeral arrangements were under way and said it would be one fit for a king. Daily News
