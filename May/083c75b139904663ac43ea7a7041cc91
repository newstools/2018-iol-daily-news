It is believed a truck collided into the back of another truck early on Monday morning. The exact cause of the collision is still being investigated by police and traffic officials who are also at the scene looking into the incident as well directing traffic. Durban Metro Police’s Parboo Sewpersadh said the accident has caused a backup of traffic as far back as Shongweni. “Motorists are advised to avoid the N3 to Marianhill altogether at this stage. Traffic is backlogged on the Durban-bound side of the freeway. Motorists are advised to rather make use of the  M13 near the vicinity of Fields Hill as an alternate route."
