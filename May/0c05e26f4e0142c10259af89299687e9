Durban - Blood stocks have hit critically low levels in KZN with the SA National Blood Service (SANBS) calling on donors to urgently donate. “We are currently sitting at less than a day’s cover at 0.9 day stock,” said SANBS spokesman Dr Solomuzi Ngcobo. “We are strongly urging donors to donate blood. A unit of whole blood donated can save at least three lives,” he said. With supplies at the blood bank already low, a new regulation which affects whether donors are eligible to donate means a possible further challenge to collecting blood in South Africa and a greater need for new donors. The new iron regulation was affected in KZN in the first week of April with a plan in place to roll it out across the country. The new iron level requirements aims to get blood from donors in a safe way and not compromise their health. A study on the iron levels of more than 4 000 randomly selected donors was performed in South-Africa, the results of which has led to changes in SANBS practices. If a female has a Haemoglobin level of less than 12.5g/dl (grams per decilitre) and a male of less than 13.5 g/dl they will not be able to donate as they are at risk of developing anaemia. They will be deferred from donating blood for six months after which the SANBS will check their haemoglobin level again. It takes the body an average of 3 to 6 months to replenish its iron stores, therefore the six months deferral time, SANBS said. However the SANBS has previously said it cannot confirm if the new iron regulations were resulting in less donations coming in. What is clear though is that blood supply is desperately in need.
