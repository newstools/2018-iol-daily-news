Durban - A man and two teenage boys were caught in the Spring Tide in Ballito on Sunday evening. Quentin Power, NSRI Ballito station manager, said the NSRI Ballito required assistance from NSRI Durban and NSRI Richards Bay after receiving reports of local people trapped on the north bank of Zinkwazi River after the river mouth opened during Spring Tide causing water flowing strongly through the river mouth into the sea. “While responding to the scene NSRI coast watchers informed us that one man, a 34-year-old, while attempting to cross the river from the South bank in an effort to reach two male teenagers, aged 14 and 15, he was swept away towards the river mouth about 100 meters downstream but was able to recover himself to the North bank where he joined the two teenagers despite losing all of his belongings in the process and he was not injured but they stayed on the North bank not willing to chance trying to get across the rapidly flowing water,” said Power. He said they had been fishing when they were cut off by the Spring Tide that also caused the mouth of the Zinkwazi river to open into the sea. He said when they arrived at the scene they were unable to reach the man and the teenagers because of the rising Spring Tide, which led them to set up a rope system and he reached the man and the teenagers by getting across to the north bank in chest deep rapidly flowing water. He said they put life jackets on and the rope system was secured between the north and south banks and they were hooked onto rope and they were able to bring all three of them to safety across the river in relays secured to the rope system without incident and they also managed to recover their fishing gear. “They were not injured and no further assistance was required,” he said.
