Elmien Hamman (previously Van der Spuy), who was the deputy head girl at Kuswag High School in eManzimtoti when Martin was the deputy head boy in 1978, was commenting on Monday's guilty verdict in the case of his son, Henri, who was convicted of murdering his father, 54, his mother, Teresa, 55, his brother, Rudi, 22, and of the attempted murder of his sister, Marli, 16, at the time of the attack in January, 2015. Henri was found to have axed his family to death in their luxury home in Stellenbosch.

Back in his matric year, Martin had a bright future. “We were really big pals until we went our separate ways and went to different universities,” recalled Hamman, who described Martin as being “very intelligent, friendly and very good with maths and science”. The softly-spoken Martin had helped her with her maths. While Martin went to the University of Stellenbosch to study engineering (he later got an MBA at the University of Pretoria), Hamman went to the University of the Free State. They met up at their school’s 10-year reunion in eManzimtoti. When news of the murders broke, pupils and teachers at Kuswag High School observed a moment’s silence for Martin and his family, said teacher Pieter van der Spuy, Hamman’s older brother, who remembers Martin well. “He was pleasant, friendly, reliable and you could tell that he had the potential to do well in business, which he did,” he said.
