Durban - THE Economic Freedom Fighters staged a walkout of the state of the city address by eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede after their call for a point of order was ignored by council Speaker William Mapena on Thursday. The party called for Mapena to entertain a motion which they claimed to have filed with his office on Wednesday. Mapena cut the EFF short, pointing out that he had ruled on the motion, and called Gumede to deliver the state of the city address. “Speaker, point of order. You are breaking the rules of the house,” EFF members shouted in unison. Mapena ignored them, while Gumede did not seem to be deterred by the point of order raised by the red overalls. Gumede praised stalwarts of the Struggle and reminded those in attendance of the discipline they had displayed. She called for an end to the abuse, physical and emotional, of children and women. “African mayors have resolved that our next forum will address the safety of women and children. I will soon share with you our plans for how we want this scourge to be dealt with,” Gumede said. The EFF left the house after their calls for a point of order were ignored. “We don’t trust the mayor and the recent recall of the Auditor-General’s team from the municipality is one of the reasons," said EFF councillor Bonginkosi Ngiba. "EThekwini is one of the biggest metros and a strategic economic hub, coupled with its international reputation. It can no longer function under such conditions as all these incidents have tainted the image of the city,” Ngiba said. The address is underway and will be followed by the city’s budget. Daily News
