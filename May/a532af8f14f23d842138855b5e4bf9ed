Professor Naven Chetty, from the School of Chemistry and Physics, said he was very happy at receiving an award. “It’s been unreal,” he said. Chetty, who has taught for 12 years, did not teach in the hopes of getting an award, but because he was passionate about teaching. He said he took a student-centred approach to teaching. “This means looking at the student’s personal circumstances and tailoring the approach to suit the student,” he said. “It is not only about teaching the content but also about helping students get an understanding and for them to think critically.” He said some students’ failings were not about their ability but about their backgrounds. Chetty said some of the students came from poor backgrounds and would come to class hungry. As he was also from a poor background, he said his personal struggles helped him empathise with poor students. For him, the greatest compliment he could receive was students thanking him. He said some had gone on to be very successful. For Dr Ansurie Pillay it was a very “pleasing experience” to receive the award. The School of Education academic said this was an affirmation of the work she and others were doing. She said her work was underpinned by a social justice agenda. Pillay said she grew up with a strong background in social justice as she and her parents had had to contend with an unjust social system. “It was something I was born into,” said the Westville resident. She said it was not about teaching, but making a difference in people’s lives every day. “The power of making a difference is something teachers have,” she said. Pillay, who has been teaching at UKZN for eight years, said a lot of work needed to be done in the area of social justice. “There are so many people who want to help. Helping others as I was helped was something I also wanted to do,” Pillay said. The third recipient, Professor Gueguim Kana, could not be reached for comment. Daily News
