Durban- The Chatsworth Anti Drug Forum (ADF) is picking up the pieces and straightening out their furniture after burglars ransacked their office in Trisula Avenue on Sunday. The ADF  was established in April 2005 to tackle the drug abuse epidemic that had gripped Durban. Their work includes education and awareness, rehabilitation and reducing drug supply. They strive for a Drug-Free Society’ Sam Pillay, ADF director, said recovering drug addicts were behind the burglary. He said it remained a mystery to him as to how they got inside the double storey facility. "I suspect they climbed up one of the pipes to the upper floor and got into the premises via a window. They ransacked the place. They got into one of the locked offices through the ceiling trap door. We have been victims of several burglaries over the years so we don't keep anything valuable inside," Pillay said. The ADF discovered that aluminium balustrades inside the office were stolen. "This is the desperate nature of drug addicts that society is faced with. They need to feed their habit continuously. They will do whatever it takes. They have bitten the hand that fed them," Pillay said. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said the complainant had locked up her place of work and went home.  When she arrived the following day she noticed that documents were scattered and balustrade aluminium was missing. Mbhele said a case of burglary at business premises was opened for investigation. No arrests had been made.     
        
Pillay said they will still continue to be a dedicated team to help the lives of people in the ongoing struggle against drug addiction. Daily News
