Delegates from across the globe have been jetting in for the three-day indaba, which this year attracted more exhibitors than previously. It is themed “Africa’s Stories, Your Success”. Tourism businesses from 21 African countries will be showcasing their products, compared with 18 last year. There was a 50% increase in small business exhibitors at the “Hidden Gems” pavilion, with 135 small South African businesses exhibiting. Small businesses were the true hidden gems of African tourism, said Phindile Makwakwa, acting chief executive of Tourism KwaZulu-Natal (TKZN). “If we want to grow tourism, we must focus on small and developing businesses. They are the true future because they empower people and provide job opportunities,” she said. More than 7000 delegates from at least 80 countries - exhibitors, buyers who scout for travel and tourism products to put in their holiday brochures, and local and international media - are expected. Indaba - one of the three “must-see” tourism trade shows in the world - which is owned by South African Tourism (SAT), is expected to generate a direct economic spend of R53 million, with about 200 part-time jobs created and R89m pumped into the KwaZulu-Natal GDP. Charles Preece, of the KZN branch of the Federated Hospitality Association of South Africa, said Durban hotel bookings were very busy with a good knock-on effect on uMhlanga. TKZN and Durban Tourism have joined forces to host several events, including a breakfast session tomorrow that will be seen live on CNBC Africa. To accommodate Indaba, Walnut Road will be closed to traffic between the ICC and the Durban Exhibition Centre until May 13. Daily News
