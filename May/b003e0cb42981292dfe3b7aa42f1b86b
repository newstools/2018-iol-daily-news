Durban- South African fast bowler Dale Steyn is the latest figure to complain about the high data costs in the country. The 34-year-old fast bowler expressed his shock at the prices on his Twitter account on Monday. “So I just bought 10GB data for R605. In Bali, I paid R120 for 25GB! Seriously! WTF?????!!!!” Steyn told his more than 3 million followers. This is one of many complaints about the high data prices that South Africans have to use. Such has been the outrage that a #DataMustFall campaign has started.      This has resulted in the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa looking into data issues facing South Africans. Much to the dismay of consumers, ICASA did not ask mobile operators lower data costs but told them to not charge out of bundle rates when data has been depleted. The regulatory authority also said service providers should give their customers of rolling over unused data. Daily News
