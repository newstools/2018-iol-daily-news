Durban - Durban residents can now WhatsApp the eThekwini Municipality when they come across faulty traffic lights. The municipality made it public when they shared it on their Facebook and Twitter pages last Friday.   Mandla Nsele, eThekwini Municipality deputy head of communications said, “We recently launched our Faulty Traffic Lights WhatsApp Reporting Line which residents can now use to report faulty lights easily. Using the number 073 148 3477, residents can send pictures and even send a location of it for ease of identification.” Nsele said the city will provide a first response within 24 hours from the time the fault is logged. Reported faults can include timings, pole knockdowns and faulty flashing. He said it is still early to tell how residents are responding to the WhatsApp reporting line. “It is still in the early stages of implementation, it is too soon to tell. However, we do receive 10 reports per day on average,” he said. EThekwini’s WhatsApp reporting lines: Water faults - 073 148 3477 Traffic lights faults - 073 148 3477 Daily News
