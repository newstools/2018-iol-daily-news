The event aims to create awareness of the Caring4Girls programme, which distributes sanitary pads to girls who miss school because of their menstrual cycle. Caring4Girls was started in 2012 by Imbumba Foundation chief executive Richard Mabaso. He felt the need to help these girls because, when he was young, one of his nieces told their granny about her menstrual cycle and the pain that came with it. “I felt helpless and wanted to come up with something that would help girls with their period,” he said. One of the first beneficiaries of the programme was Charlotte Sibiya, who is now a Fort Hare University graduate. The 22-year-old tearfully thanked Mabaso for restoring her faith in men. She said her success in achieving a BSc degree would not have been possible if it was not for this programme. For Sibiya, celebrating Menstrual Hygiene Day was gratifying, especially because all the people who played different roles in Caring4Girls attended. “Corporates take time out of their busy schedules to support this programme,” she said. Media personality Cathy Mohlanana led a panel discussion with Lynn Forbes, grandmother to Ntombezinhle ‘DJ Zinhle’ Jiyane’s daughter. Jiyane was also on the panel. Other panellists were Sibiya; Tebogo More, the chief executive of Avon and ­Dedisa Peaking Power, which is a corporate partner; and Mama­bolo. Some of the issues discussed focused on the need for women to be comfortable with their menstrual cycle, negating the notion that menstruation is dirty, educating women about menstrual hygiene and the issue of young girls missing school because of a lack of pads and period pain. Aphelele Dube and Duduzile Mdluli, in Grades 8 and 11 respectively at Groutville High School, said the next discussion should include boys so that they knew how girls felt. Premier Willies Mchunu’s wife, Zodwa Mchunu, said all issues raised would be taken to the premier’s office and the government. Daily News
