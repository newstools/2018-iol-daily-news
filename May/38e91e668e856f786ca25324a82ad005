Durban - The body of newborn baby girl was found in a dustbin in the Durban city on Tuesday afternoon. Russel Meiring, ER24 spokesperson said ER24 paramedics were called to the scene by local authorities and arrived at the scene after 1pm. “Upon arrival, paramedics found the body of the newborn lying in plastic on the sidewalk. It is understood that the body had been taken out of the dustbin by a member of the public. Paramedics assessed the newborn and found no signs of life. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for the girl and she was declared dead,” Meiring said. He said details surrounding the incident are unknown but police were on scene and will be investigating. Police could not be reached at the time of publication. In April, ER24 paramedics were called to the scene after SAPS Search and Rescue called them requesting medical assistance at Mountain Rise in Pietermaritzburg after finding an abandoned baby girl. “Paramedics assessed the infant and found that she had sustained no injuries but was suffering from low body temperature. The infant was immediately warmed and transported to a nearby hospital for further treatment,” he said. Daily News
