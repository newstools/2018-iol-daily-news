Justin Taylor, Zimbali’s operations and environmental manager, said they had a healthy snake population in the area. He explained that a resident had called about a snake on their property, which was captured and relocated. However, the snake returned to the property because it had to incubate its eggs. After contacting herpetologist Nick Evans, Taylor was told to take the eggs to uShaka so they could be taken care of properly. Evans said he received guidance from a professor and was told the mother would probably abandon the eggs after being disturbed by her removal. He said pythons were one of the few snakes that guarded their eggs and helped incubate them. “If she was not going to come back, the snakes would never hatch,” he said. “I came to collect them. We dug them out of a pool pump house and I took them to uShaka.” uShaka herpetologist Lesley Labuschagne said they incubated and hatched the eggs in February. “When the eggs arrived, we separated those we could see were not viable so that they wouldn’t contaminate the good eggs.”  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

The team placed the eggs on sand in an old box, added water and a fish-tank heater set at 36C. “After five days we ‘candled’ the eggs, by putting a light behind them so we could see which of the 18 we had saved were viable. We could see there were little embryos growing inside,” she said. A month later, the eggs started hatching. Pythons lay about 40 eggs at a time and are a threatened and protected species on the Cites list. “You have to have a permit to hold them. You’re not allowed to keep them as pets and you’re not allowed to harm them,” she said. They grow to about 6m and sometimes bigger. “They are solitary animals and they only come together to find each other.” Daily News
