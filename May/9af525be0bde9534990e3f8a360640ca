Durban- Hijackers took two Reservoir Hills businessmen on a terror ride before dumping them on the roadside unharmed in Ntuzuma on Monday night. Five hijackers pounced on the Yasteel Panday and Kavir Maharaj while they were socialising with friends on Magpie Road in Reservoir Hills. The hijackers, at gunpoint, forced the men into their vehicles, a BMW 528i  and an Audi A4. Both cars were found in Ntuzuma. Residents who witnessed the hijacking called the police. Friends who were with them but were left behind called their family. Both the vehicle tracking companies were notified and the Community Policing Forum sprung into action. Ish Prahladh, Iron Force security spokesperson, described it as a well-orchestrated hijacking. "The hijackers were in the area during the course of the day pretending to be buying houses. They must have been scouting. I think they had come for another car on the same road but were unlucky. The boys were in the wrong place at the wrong time. They were left shaken by the incident. It was a hell of a ride for them. They thought they were going to die," he said. Prahladh said the hijackers did not take a double cab bakkie because it had the company logo emblazoned throughout the vehicle. "The hijackers also had a white Ford ST which we heard stopped the traffic at intersections to allow the two hijacked cars to pass through quickly," Prahladh said. Police had not responded at the time of publishing. Daily News
