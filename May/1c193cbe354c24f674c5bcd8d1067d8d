However, members of the political party claimed yesterday that Ganesh was no longer a member. Rashina Singh, national general-secretary of Mosa, said Ganesh had been expelled after disciplinary hearings were held against him. “He was expelled for bringing the party into disrepute,” she said. She added that he was not a PR councillor. Singh said Ganesh had failed to attend disciplinary hearings. She also claimed the party had not discussed the orange bag matter with its legal team. She said Ganesh was acting in his personal capacity when he filed a formal complaint on the tender scandal. Irregularities were found by a forensic audit into the tender. Some of the findings included that Persian Star Investments 11 CC did not have the proper capacity to carry it out. Ganesh denied Singh’s allegations. “This is a load of hogwash,” he said. Ganesh said he was still the leader of the party and was elected at its national conference. He said Singh was not elected to any position. He said the position she was in was self-nominated. Ganesh said the party had its elective conference in December. “If they are distancing themselves from the orange bag scandal, one should question the motivation. “These are troublemakers who are trying to bring the good work of the party into disrepute,” he said.
