Durban - KwaZulu-Natal is fortunate to have loggerhead and leatherback turtles nest on our sandy beaches, Ann Kunz, uShaka Seaworld education officer, said on Wednesday as World Turtle Day celebrations kicked off. Kunz said globally, there are seven species of sea turtles – of these, five occur in South African waters. Kunz was also delighted to announce that a two-year-old green turtle named Wellington will be released soon in a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in northern KZN. Wellington was brought to the uShaka Sea World rehabilitation centre in October 2016 where she was cared for by aquarists Malini Pather and Kelly Brown. "Wellington arrived as a hatchling with a flipper injury. All went well during the rehabilitation programme. She is now fully recovered and after undergoing her final health checks on Tuesday she is fit for release next week," Kunz said. Hawksbill and green turtles forage (feed) along the KZN coast, while olive Ridley turtles are considered vagrants who pass by while going to their intended destinations and occasionally strand on our shores. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has classified all seven species of sea turtles as threatened. Turtles have recently become the ambassador species for the global campaign against plastic pollution. Turtles mistake plastic bags as jellyfish, which is a major component of some species’ diets. This results in turtles not being able to further feed, suffocation and buoyancy issues. A recent study revealed that 50% of the world’s turtles may have plastic in their system. Kunz said as consumers, we can make a difference by avoiding single-use plastic items like cups, bags and straws and encouraging others to follow suit. Why are we concerned about turtles?  All seven species of turtles are threatened. Some of the major threats include:   What can we do to save turtles?   Daily News
