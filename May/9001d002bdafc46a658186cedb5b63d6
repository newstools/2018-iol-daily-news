Durban - Four KwaZulu-Natal cricketers have been nominated for four Cricket South Africa Awards. The awards will take place on June 2 at Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg. Sarel Erwee, Nduduzo Mfoza, Keshav Maharaj and Chloe Tryon were each nominated for one award. Erwee and Mfoza were nominated for the Africa T20 Cup Rising Star Award. He had scored 231 runs in the Africa Cup with an average of 77 and a strike rate of over 150. He also scored three half centuries. Erwee was recently named Momentum One Day Cup Batsman of the Year at the Hollywoodbets Dolphins award ceremony. Mfoza finished with the second most wickets in the tournament with an economy of just over six runs an over and claimed six wickets. Both Erwee and Mfoza played a huge role in securing the title for the Hollywoodbets KZN Inland team. Left-arm spinner, Keshav Maharaj, is nominated alongside Lungi Ngidi and Kagiso Rabada for the Ram Delivery of the Year award. Last year Maharaj had won the International Newcomer of the Year award. In women’s cricket, Chloe Tryon is nominated for the T20 Women’s Cricketer of the Year award. Tryon played a big role in leading the Momentum Proteas to the ICC Women’s World Cup semi-final in 2017. Heinrich Strydom, Chief Executive Officer of KwaZulu-Natal Cricket commended the players for the role they played in a memorable season for KZN cricket. “We are immensely proud of these individual players who represented the province with passion and pride, and played pivotal roles in the success of the various teams that they represented,” Strydom said. "They contributed to an incredible season for KZN Cricket and made it possible to win three out of a possible six senior male trophies nationally, in the form of the Hollywoodbets Dolphins sharing the Momentum Cup, KZN Coastal winning the Sunfoil 3-day Cup and Hollywoodbets KZN Inland winning the Africa T20 Cup," he said.
