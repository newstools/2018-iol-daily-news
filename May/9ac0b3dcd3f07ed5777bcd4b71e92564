The crowd-grabber was Daytona’s Vega-blue McLaren 570s Spider. Ramon Saffy, from the Daytona car dealership in Sandton, said the car attracted people because of the style and the fact that it is fairly new compared to the more popular Ferrari. The drop-top beauty would set one back about R4.7 million, but, according to Saffy, it would definitely be worth it. On the art front, The Melrose Gallery was exhibiting work from the likes of popular Ndebele artist Dr Esther Mahlangu. Exhibition technician Richard Mavura from the Melrose Gallery said the turnout had been great since the beginning of the festival on Thursday. According to Varsha Jayram, IBV marketing manager, the aim of the festival was to create as much awareness as possible of the talent available in Durban. On Saturday, they hosted the first IBV Supercar auction which had about 40 vintage cars up for grabs, such as the 1983 Cadillac Eldorado and the 1975 Mercedes E280. A fashion show was also held on Saturday, where fashion designers and Gateway stores showcased their ready-to-wear outfits. “All exhibitioners did not have to pay a fee. All we wanted was to bring awareness to people’s work. “The supercar auction was a great success with people squeezing in to try and get a look at the cars,” said Jayram. IBV hoped to attract 400 000 people and Jayram was certain they had exceeded that number. “The festival was such a success and now we can host the same in some of the IBV branches in London, Switzerland and Dubai,” she said.
