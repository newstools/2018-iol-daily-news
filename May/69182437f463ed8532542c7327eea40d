Durban - A Durban businesswoman was pistol-whipped by a gang of robbers using a Mercedes Benz at her home in Morningside on Sunday. The gang dubbed the Mercedes gang has been behind a spate of robberies in the Morningside area in recent weeks. Captain Nqobile Gwala, aÂ KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said that the woman was in her Earl Haig Road home when three men carrying firearms walked in. "At gunpoint the suspects ransacked the house and took jewellery, firearms, cash and fled the scene in their getaway vehicle. No arrests have been made," Gwala said. A police source said the robbers had derailed the front driveway gate, broke the front door and gate before getting into the house. The robbers dragged the woman around the house demanding she direct them to the safe. The husband was unharmed during the ordeal. The blood splatter on the interior of the house bore testament to the beating the robbers handed down to the woman. The woman owns a reputable interior design company in Durban. She has been hospitalised at a local hospital to recover from her injuries. A video of the incident shows the exterior of the house and how the robbers got in. The video footage was taken from a neighbouring property that faces the businesswoman`s home.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
