Durban-born Tomson, who is now based in California, is an author, journalist and businessman - and South Africaâ€™s only professional world surfing champion. It was the untimely loss of his son Mathew that turned his life around. Inspired by a poem (The Light Shines Ahead), which he shared with his dad shortly before he died, Tomson and his wife, Carla, found the courage to help young people make positive choices for lifelong change. Tomson has partnered with the KwaDukuza Municipality to engage local youth for the Shaun Tomson Positive Wave Tour from June 18 to 22. Daily News
