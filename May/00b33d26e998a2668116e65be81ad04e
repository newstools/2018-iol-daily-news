Durban- Motorists need to get verified updated information before heading out on the N3 highway to Gauteng, the N3 Toll Concession (N3TC) company which manages the toll route said on Monday. The Mooi Toll Plaza was closed on Monday whilst a recovery, clean-up and repair operations took place after 18 trucks were set alight by angry protestors on Sunday night. Southbound traffic was being diverted at Estcourt through Greytown to Pietermaritzburg. Northbound traffic was diverted at the Mooi River (Wimpy) off-ramps onto the R103 and then back onto the N3 Toll Route at Hidcote/Estcourt. Eighteen 18 trucks were set alight, on Sunday, during a protest action in the vicinity of the Mooi Toll Plaza near the town of Mooi River in KwaZulu-Natal. The N3 Toll Route had to be closed in this region. “Judging by the high traffic volumes experienced on the N3 Toll Route at the start of the long weekend, it is expected that thousands of vehicles will be returning towards Gauteng (northbound) on Tuesday. All resources, including SAPS, traffic officials, emergency services and the N3TC patrol teams, have been deployed to ensure safety. At this stage, further protest action cannot be ruled out although every effort is being made by law enforcement authorities to contain the situation,” explains N3TC’s commercial manager, Con Roux. It is strongly recommended to anyone planning to travel in the next few days to obtain prior information about travel conditions along the N3 Toll Route. Under the current condition traffic congestion and delays can be expected. Contact the 24-hour N3 Route Helpline on 0800 63 4357 to get traffic updates and follow N3TC on Twitter: @N3Route for real-time traffic reports.
