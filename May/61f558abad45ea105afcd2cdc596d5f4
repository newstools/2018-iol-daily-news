Govender, 77, was the founder of the Bala Govender and Sons studios, and became known for his contribution to the political struggle through his lens. Govender’s brother-in-law and fellow photographer Sydney Reddy said: “He is the one who taught me everything. He trained me to become a photographer. I have been in the ­business for 55 years and I respect him so much for everything.” Reddy said among the events covered by Govender was the visit to South Africa of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth, and graduation ceremonies. Govender leaves behind his wife, Dolly, son Trevor, daughter Ronica, a daughter-in-law, a son-in-law, grandchildren and numerous friends. Reddy described Govender’s 65-year career as a great one.
