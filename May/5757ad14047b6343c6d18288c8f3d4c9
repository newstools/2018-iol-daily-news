A few conversations later, and Smith and 10 friends are preparing for a royal celebration of their own, as they get together to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding on TV on Saturday. “We’re having a girls’ brunch. We’re getting dressed up and we’re going to celebrate.” After collecting props for their brunch from the British Cultural and Heritage Association in Durban, Smith sent a photo of them to her nephew in London - “And now he’s been inspired to do something,” she said. “I’m a great show-off,” Smith joked of her British pride. “I’ve been living in Durban for about 40 years now, but the wedding is a celebration all over. I think it’s a great opportunity to just kick off your shoes, relax and enjoy a wonderful moment for the couple. “There is so much misery and gloom that makes the news; now is our chance to celebrate something good.” David Warmback, the honorary British Consul in Durban, has been invited to a private house for the celebration. He will be sporting his UK/South Africa badge on his suit and wearing his Union Jack cufflinks. Daily News
