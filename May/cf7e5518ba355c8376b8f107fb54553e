Durban - Police have said only a few police stations in South Africa are experiencing a shortage of DNA and rape kits. This comes after media reports suggesting that the shortage is countrywide. In a statement, police said they had entered into a tender process in order to get more evidence collection kits. “Two of the suppliers that took part in the bid process were disqualified because they could not meet the specifications as outlined by the department. During this process, the SAPS however discovered that the third supplier that did meet the required specifications is currently under criminal investigation. Therefore, the SAPS could not continue with the awarding of the tender,” the statement said. In order to avoid a lack of these resources, police have embarked on a procurement process through a quotation basis. In the process, they have identified some companies and they are currently assessing their suitability to provide the required evidence collection kits. “To ensure that that we continue to provide an efficient and effective policing service, the SAPS is also currently in the process of redistributing the evidence collection kits to clusters and stations that are experiencing shortages. The SAPS is satisfied that these actions will ensure that there is sufficient stock for a period of two months whilst the acquisition process unfolds,” the statement said. Daily News
