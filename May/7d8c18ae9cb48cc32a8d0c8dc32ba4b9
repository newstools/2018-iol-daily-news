Durban - A 57- year-old man is in a critical condition after being mauled by two Rottweilers in Phoenix on Friday. Glen Naidoo, KZN Vip Unit spokesperson, said the man has been working at the home for approximately 10 years when he was mauled by the dogs who he looked after in Shastri Park. "It is still unconfirmed as to what triggered the attack. The man was bitten throughout his entire body. Advanced Life Support intervention was needed and together with Kzn Vip Medics the patient was rushed to a hospital," Naidoo said. The SPCA was called in immediately by the homeowners to take away the 2 Rottweilers from the home after they feared for their lives. Tanya Fleischer, Kloof and Highway SPCA spokesperson, said the dogs were collected and they were euthanized as per the owner’s request. A 72-year-old woman was attacked by a Rottweiler in Verulam, north of Durban in February. Prem Balram, Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa)  spokesperson, said the dog had bitten the woman multiple times. “Rusa were called out to the scene by residents who reported hearing a woman screaming for help. The elderly female explained that she was walking to a nearby business when the dog ran onto the road and repeatedly bit her on her leg. During the attack, she was knocked to the ground and bitten on her hands and back. The woman attempted to push the dog away and screamed for help. The owner of the dog ran to her aid and managed to stop the dog from attacking further,” said Balram. Daily News
