Durban - A 30-year-old woman was discharged from hospital after being struck on the head with a gun during a hijacking inÂ Overport on Monday. The family did not want to be named but her brother-in-law told the Daily News that she had entered the driveway of her cousins home in Kenilworth Avenue and while waiting for the gate to open a white Toyota Etios boxed her in. "Two men rushed to her BMW from either side. Both pointed guns at her through the window. They forced her out of the car. They pulled at her hands. She was trying to explain that her daughters aged 11 and 10 were in the car," the relative said. While the woman was pleading with the hijackers to let the children out they hit her with the butt of the gun on her head. It is alleged they had also slapped her with the gun and told her to be quiet. "At first they threatened to shoot them. They somehow felt compassionate and let the girls out of the car. They sped off. Police and private security companies tried to track the whereabouts of the vehicle but it just seemed to have disappeared," the relative said. The girl's school bags and some personal family belongings were in the boot of the car. Captain Ngobile Gwala, KwaZulu Natal police spokesperson, said Sydenham Police are investigating a case of hijacking. Daily News
