The battle with the city, First Metro Housing and the residents has been continuing for more than 10 years. About 60 families were evicted last year. The residents said they were told they would own their homes after paying rent for a certain period. A member of the Howell Road Committee, who could not be named, said they would be accompanying municipal officials to Cornubia to look at houses next week. He said they expected about 22 families to move to Cornubia, a government low-cost housing project, in the next few weeks. “It has come to this and we have given up,” he said. They feared the houses in Cornubia would be small. The latest development was not well received by the community. Read: Committee investigates Howell Road evictions “They are livid.

This would include changing schools and increased transport costs. One of the people having to make such a change is Thembeka Ngcobo. “We have been living here for 15 years, and consider this our home. We have tried and tried to get our homes in Howell Road and failed. I have given up,” she said. The municipality had referred the Daily News to the Department of Human Settlements for comment.
