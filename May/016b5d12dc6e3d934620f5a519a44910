Durban - A Glenwood family was woken up by a house full of smoke in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Russel Meiring, ER24 spokesperson said, ER24 paramedics were called to the scene of the incident by the fire service. Meiring said the paramedics found that the fire services had already extinguished the fire that had broken out in one room. “Five people, including two young children, were assessed and found to have suffered minor to mild smoke inhalation. Paramedics treated the patients and thereafter transported the three adults to Mediclinic Pietermaritzburg for further treatment. The two children were transported privately to hospital,” he said. He said the cause of the incident in unknown but the relevant authorities will be investigating further. Last month a 19-year-old woman was left with numerous burn wounds after a fire broke out at a residence in Northdale. ER24 paramedics treated her and transported her to Greys Provincial Hospital for further treatment. ER24 has urged people to remember safety first when trying to stay warm. Unfortunately, trying to keep warm during winter does present itself with certain risks such as fires, gas leaks and many others. Ineke van Huyssteen of ER24 said, “It is not uncommon for emergency personnel to get called out to residential fires especially during winter. In many cases, paramedics treat people for smoke inhalation or severe burn injuries.” Daily News
