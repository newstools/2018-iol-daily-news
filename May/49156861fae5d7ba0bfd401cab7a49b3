Durban- Angry residents from the Cato Crest informal settlement in Cato Manor have blockaded the Vusi Mzimela (Bellair) Road with rubble, refuse and chopped up tree branches. Police believe that the demolishing of several shacks, by the eThekwini municipality, that was built illegally along King Cetshwayo (Jan Smuts) Highway on Sunday could have sparked the protest. The road is closed from Felix Dlamini (Brickfield) Road and King Cetshwayo (Jan Smuts) Highway intersection towards Mayville. Police have closed the roads at the following intersections:     Police are directing traffic onto alternative routes.  The incident has caused chaos on the roads during Monday morning peak hour traffic. Metro and SAPS Public Order Policing Units are on the scene dispersing the group of protestors. The area is prone to sporadic acts of protests because of the vast number of informal settlements that have been built in the area which has been spreading and increasing in number because of the land grabs.
