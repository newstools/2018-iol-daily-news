Durban -A Filipino fisherman with stab wounds to his stomach had to be evacuated from a fishing vessel in rough sea conditions on Monday. Clifford Ireland, NSRI Durban station commander, said the Durban duty crew were placed on alert by  Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC) to prepare to evacuate an injured fisherman onboard a fishing vessel that was heading towards Durban from deep sea and expected to be 50 nautical miles off-shore by Monday mid-afternoon. "In communications between MRCC, the ship`s agent and the fishing vessel and a medical assessment made by a Government Health EMS duty doctor, it was determined that the patient, suffering knife wounds to the stomach, was in a serious condition," Ireland said. On Monday morning, the NSRI sea rescue craft Eikos Rescuer II launched, accompanied by a Netcare 911 rescue paramedic.  Ireland said upon reaching 30 nautical miles out to sea and with sea conditions found to be too rough to risk a medical patient transfer at sea by boat the FU KUO No. 101, at that stage 50 nautical miles from Durban, was informed to continue towards Durban Port at best speed. In the interim, Transnet National Ports Authority TNPA activated their Marine Pilot Services helicopter. "The ports authority marine pilot services Augusta A109 helicopter accompanied by a Netcare 911 rescue paramedic responded and rendezvoused with the fishing vessel 11.4 nautical miles off-shore of Durban," he said. "On arrival on the scene, in rough seas with a 2 to 3-metre swell and strong winds exceeding 40 knots, the rescue paramedic was hoisted onto the fishing vessel. The fisherman received medical treatment. He was then secured into a Ferno stretcher and hoisted into the helicopter," Ireland explained. Medical treatment continued in the helicopter and the patient has been airlifted to a hospital in Durban in a serious but stable condition where he is to undergo surgery. Ireland said the rescue operation was completed at 7 pm on Monday. Daily News
