Nad Shahid, Managing Director of  Urban Lime in a statement to the Daily News said they understood the frustrations of the tenants and were working to address all the issues raised. “Urban Lime Management provide property management services to the building 320 Pixley which is owned by landlord Intrepid Heights (Pty) Ltd which is co-owned with Johannesburg based property developers Propertuity who have recently withdrawn from the Durban market which has resulted in delays to the refurbishment of 320 Pixley. “Contractors Otis regularly service and repair the current lifts and were in fact on-site today when their technicians were prevented from doing their work. We would hope to have Otis back on site this afternoon,” Shahid said. Shahid said the lifts at 320 Pixley were all being replaced at a cost of around R12m. “Orders were placed in November 2017 and a six month replacement program with the first new lifts fitted and operational from the end of June 2018. Our buildings all conform to health and safety standards, and electricity is recharged on usage, on a tenant by tenant usage basis at industry standard.  However, Urban Lime Management will be further assessing cleaning services for the bathrooms as a result of today’s meeting. “Urban Lime Properties have a strong, proven track record of commercial property urban regeneration and sensitive restoration of iconic buildings.  The current situation with 320 Pixley is frustrating, but will be resolved and we look forward to restoring this iconic Durban building to its former glory”.
