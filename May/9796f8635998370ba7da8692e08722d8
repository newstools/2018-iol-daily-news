Police have launched an investigation into the shooting between a gang of hijackers and community members that led to her death on Monday. The drama started when her father was hijacked while he was on his way to leave her at Everest Primary School. A person who witnessed the drama unfold, and who is believed to be an off-duty police officer, apparently fired several shots at the fleeing vehicle. The hijacker lost control of the car a few hundred metres away and veered into a park at the corner of Caucasus and Himalaya drives. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the off-duty police officer gave chase and apprehended one man. A second man died at the scene and a third is thought to have escaped. Sadia was transported to a hospital where she died. Daily News
