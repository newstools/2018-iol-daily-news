Gwala said that after the police arrested the suspect, they were approached by four more victims who alleged the man had also sexually assaulted them. He charged with three counts of rape and two counts of sexual assault. According to members of the community, they were horrified after the man was arrested as he and his wife ran a creche in the area. None of the victims however attended  the creche. Rocky Naidoo Deputy Chairperson of the Bayview Community Policing Forum said they wanted the court not to grant the suspect bail.

He said it was worrying that some of the cases date back from last year. "We are here to say the courts should not grant rape suspects bail. The victims were too terrified to open the charges and now that they had the courage to report him, they should be protected by keeping the suspect in jail," said Naidoo. Daily News
