The 28-year-old had decided to return to school full-time to improve his results. He was a full-time Grade 12 pupil at the Nkandla school last year. He said he had expected a university entrance pass and was disappointed to learn his certificate would earn him space at an FET college. “It is not the end of my university dream. To me a higher certificate is like not having matric at all. I wanted nothing less than a university entrance pass so that I could study teaching at university,” he said. Mthethwa left school in 2008 to work at factories to provide for a child he fathered when he was 18. “I worked piecemeal jobs at different factories and I had no choice but to work. I decided to return to school to get a matric qualification because I earned peanuts,” he said. Although obtaining a Higher Certificate pass meant he had passed ­matric, he felt that going back to school full-time to improve his pass was a better option. Mthethwa said he was aware of alternatives, including supplementary exams, and would not rest until he obtained excellent results. “I want others who did not achieve what they had hoped for not to lose hope. Going back and reflecting on where they went wrong would be the best decision to make,” he said. “I had prepared myself that if I did not achieve a bachelor’s degree entry, I was going to go back and try all over again, and that is exactly what I am going to do when schools re-open.”  He was concerned about whether the school would take him back as a full-time pupil. “I cannot afford to be at a finishing school in the city, and there are no finishing schools in my rural village. I hope to get accepted at my old school.”  Daily News
