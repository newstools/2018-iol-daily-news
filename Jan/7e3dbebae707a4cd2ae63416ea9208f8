Durban - The province's top Grade 12 achievers in the National Senior Certificate exams were honoured at a ceremony hosted at Durban's International Convention Centre on Friday. The Daily News caught up with Lethukuthula Khumalo, who was announced as KwaZulu-Natal's top achiever from the Class of 2017. She achieved eight As. The 17-year-old pupil from Velangaye High School in Nkandla said she was shocked when she received a call from her mother, informing her that she had to be at the ICC on Friday morning. "I am sure there is more information that they are keeping from me," she said. The teen attributed her success to aligning her study plans with former pupils at her school and working harder that they had.

Khumalo said she also worked consistently throughout the year and kept her eye on the prize. She plans to study medicine at the University of KwaZulu-Natal's Nelson R Mandela medical school, where she hopes to specialise in oncology. She had heard that there was a shortage of oncologists in the province and hoped to work in that field.  "I want to show people what a woman can achieve. I want to work so hard that I do not have to introduce myself to anyone; they must know who I am," she said. Khumalo wished the Class of 2018 well and said hard work and studying into the late hours does pay off.  Daily News
