Durban - Monkey business requires perseverance and time said, Steve Smit of Monkey Helpline Durban, after he found the monkey that was painted yellow in Moseley. 
Smit and Carol Booth, co-founder of the Helpline, had received a call from Sam Govindasamy of Chester Road, who spotted the monkey in his garden. Smit arrived and saw the monkey sitting on top of a 3 metre high Avocado tree. He set the monkey trap nearby with bananas inside. He waited for more than two hours before the monkey made up its mind to get into the trap. Smit then whisked the monkey away to the veterinarian. 
"The Govindasamy family were awesome. They noticed the monkey in distress and under severe threat of attack by other members of his troop.They also kept an eye on his movements until we arrived," Smit said. 
On Tuesday, the monkey was seen in Currie Crescent several streets away from where he was caught. There was a huge outcry by wildlife lovers after noticing the monkey with yellow paint on his body. 
"He had paint on his eye and inside his eyelids. We are delighted to have caught him and given him the medical treatment he deserves. We took the opportunity, while waiting, to educate neighbours and workers in the area about monkeys habits," Smit said.  Daily News
