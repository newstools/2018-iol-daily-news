Durban - The search for a missing hiker in the Drakensberg mountains has entered its third day.  Gavin Raubenheimer, Mountain Club of SA - Search And Rescue convener, said the lone hiker had gone missing on a hike in the Mlambonja valley at Cathedral Peak. The KwaZulu Natal branch of the MCSA are continuing with the ground search. Raubenheimer said Search and Rescue and the SAPS Airwing helicopter crashed while landing near the contour path in the Mlambonja valley in northern Drakensberg.  "There were no injuries to the 2 pax and 2 crew members on board but a search dog sustained light injuries. One of the pax was a senior member of the KZN rescue team. All were airlifted out later by a SAAF 15 Squadron Oryx helicopter," Raubenheimer said. Â  Last Wednesday, MCSA rescued two Belgian hikers from the steep slopes in this valley, northern Drakensberg. Raubenheimer said the hikers got lost and had got into a dangerous situation above some cliffs. The South African Air Force's 15 Squadron winched them on board an A109 at an altitude of 7800 feet. The hikers were taken to safety at the Mweni Centre for a medical exam before being released. The MCSA could not divulge the details of the hikers.  Daily News
