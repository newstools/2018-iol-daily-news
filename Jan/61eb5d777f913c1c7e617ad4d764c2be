Durban - The National Practitioners Association of SA (Nafupa SA) has said that they will not back down from their call that Indian and white funeral operators to stay away from townships and rural areas, as of February 1. Speaking at a media briefing in uMlazi on Wednesday, the association’s Muzi Hlengwa, disputed claims that they would attack white and Indian-owned. Hlengwa, Nafupa SA president, said they are not being racist by calling for black residents to support black business. “This is what we call ‘township economy’. Black people's money must stay with black people. We want them to know that black areas are now reserved for black business,” Hlengwa said. He added, “We are not asking. We are tired of asking. We are now telling them. Stay away from our areas.”  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
