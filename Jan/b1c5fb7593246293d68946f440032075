The 15-year-old allegedly went to the teacher’s home early on Saturday and broke windows with stones. When Kingston Vhiya, 42, a teacher at Bosele Middle School in Manyeding Village near Kuruman, Northern Cape, went outside the house, the boy allegedly hit him with a stone on the chest before stabbing him to death. Vhiya, of Zimbabwe, started teaching at the school last year. Zeky Mangei, a friend who was with Vhiya, said he had been stabbed after leaving the house to try to talk to the boy. “He accused Kingston of failing him. Kingston told him that he could not blame him and that he should speak to individual subject teachers,” Mangei said. “A few minutes later, I heard Kingston cry out. He said he had been stabbed.” Vhiya was taken to hospital. Northern Cape police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Dimakatso Mooi said the pupil was expected to appear in the Mothibistad Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. Northern Cape Education spokesperson Geoffrey van der Merwe had not responded to questions at the time of going to print. Daily News
