This after the World Health Organisation (WHO) included “gaming disorder” on its list of mental health conditions in the Beta draft of its latest International Classification of Diseases.  WHO included “gaming disorder” under the mental, behavioural or neuro developmental disorders category.  “Disorders due to addictive behaviours include gambling disorder and gaming disorder, which may involve both online and off-line behaviour.  “Gaming disorder is characterised by a pattern of persistent or recurrent gaming behaviour (‘digital gaming’ or ‘video-gaming’), which may be online or offline, manifested by: 1) impaired control over gaming (onset, frequency, intensity, duration, termination, context); 2) increasing priority given to gaming to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other life interests and daily activities; and 3) continuation or escalation of gaming despite negative consequences.” Gamer and gaming commentator Pippa Tshabalala said that the inclusion was looking at extreme cases. “I think anything done in excess is dangerous, and that can be anything from playing games to taking drugs they are looking at extreme cases,” she said. Tshabalala said the average gamer was not doing that and it was not easy to say how much time one person spent playing games. “The average person is not doing that. It is usually a coping mechanism for an underlying problem.” Serious About Games, a South African gaming community, released a report that said locally, revenue in the industry increased from R29.7 million in 2014 to R100m in 2016.  It said consumers of video games in South Africa are increasingly diverse.  “Across all demographics, more and more people are playing games on their PCs, consoles and cellphones than ever before.” Daily News
