Durban -  The recovery of an unlicensed firearm helped to solve a two year murder investigation. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele police spokesperson, said police in Eshowe were conducting patrols when they received information about a man who was carrying an unlicensed firearm. “The members started to trace the suspect and they saw a man fitting the same description and he was searched. An unlicensed  9mm pistol was found in his possession with three live rounds,” Mbhele said. The man was charged with carrying an unlicensed firearm and appeared at the Eshowe magistrates court on Monday, she said. The case was remanded to  February 5 2018 for bail application. “Upon further investigation about the arrested suspect, it appeared that he was one of the suspects who were allegedly involved in the killing of Sfundo Zulu (24) at Eshowe area in 2016. The same unlicensed firearm found in his possession is suspected to be used in the killing of the deceased,” she said. Mbhele said in 2016 Zulu was driving his bakkie in the Sqwanjana area in Eshowe. As he neared his homestead he was approached by three suspects who allegedly shot him in the leg and chest. Zulu lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a tree. The victim later died of his injuries at hospital, she said. Daily News
