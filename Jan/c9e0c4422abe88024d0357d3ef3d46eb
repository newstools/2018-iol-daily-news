The commission is investigating political killings in KwaZulu-Natal. Tshibase, a father of three, was also a schoolteacher. He was shot dead in May at his home in Gugwini village. He had served as a ward councillor for two terms (10 years) and was a PR councillor at the time of his death. “He told me that he had enemies, that some people did not want him to be a councillor and that it was internal ANC politics. But he refused to leave politics as he was loved by the community and wanted to continue serving them,” Diko said. She said her husband knew his life was in danger, but she never thought he would be assassinated. Khaya Thobela, uMzimkhulu council ANC deputy secretary in the Harry Gwala region, and speaker, was shot at his home in April and former ward councillor Khayelihle Mngcwaba was shot dead at his house in Machunwin in May. “We became extremely cautious when these murders began. “In the weeks leading up to his death, we were not able to communicate about sensitive matters concerning his safety over the phone, as he suspected that his phone had been bugged,” Diko said. She said that Tshibase had also tried to be at home as early as possible to avoid being ­ambushed. Several witnesses had told the commission they believed the killings were connected to corruption and the mismanagement of public funds in the multimillion-rand upgrades to the uMzimkhulu Memorial Hall. Diko, who works for the uMzimkhulu Municipality as an administrator, described her husband as a humble man with integrity. She said the family was struggling to adjust to life without him. “His death has brought pain to the family. “He was killed as we were planning our child’s first birthday. His son will grow up not knowing his father, and that hurts me,” she said. No arrests have been made, but Diko said the police had kept her up to date on a monthly basis on the status of the investigations. Daily News
