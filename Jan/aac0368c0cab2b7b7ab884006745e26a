Durban - A Grade R pupil, who went missing in Verulam on Wednesday afternoon, has been found. Snothando Myeni, 5, was reported to have gone missing after attending her first day of school. Prem Balram of Reaction Unit SA (Rusa) said she was located at an informal settlement in Redcliffe, Verulam, approximately five kilometres from her school. Initially it was thought that she boarded the wrong transport vehicle and was dropped off in an unfamiliar area. However, Balram said she was found walking aimlessly on Sapphire Road in Everest Heights after her transport was delayed. "The people who found her took the child to an informal settlement in Redcliffe and left her with a resident who circulated a missing person's report via WhatsApp. The child's mother received the circulation a short while ago and contacted Rusa for assistance,” he said. Rusa officers together with Snothando's family proceeded to the informal settlement where she was reunited with her family. Balram said Rusa had received a report earlier in the day after another pupil boarded the wrong transport vehicle. The child was found shortly after going missing. Daily News
