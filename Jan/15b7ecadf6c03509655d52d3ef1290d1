Durban - An 107-year-old grandmother from Mpophomeni, near Howick in KwaZulu-Natal was murdered in her bed on Sunday night. Weziwe Thusi, the MEC for Social Development in KwaZulu-Natal expressed shock regarding the murder of the elderly woman. Thusi said that according to one of the grandmother’s grandchildren, they heard a noise around midnight and went to investigate, only to run into a man, trying to escape. The alleged killer (39) was out on parole for two cases of rape. He was arrested on Monday and handed to the police by one of his family members. “This is an example of how unsafe women are in the communities where they live. This grandmother was attacked in the safety of her home by a man young enough to be her grandchild who is known to the family. In a normal society this young man should have been the one protecting the family,” said Thusi. “We must take comfort in the fact that his own family disapproved of his actions and handed him to police. I wish all families who find themselves in a similar situation would show the courage displayed by this man's family,” continued Thusi. The man is expected to appear at the Howick Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. Thusi said the Department of Social Development will join civil society organizations in a picket outside the court calling for the man to be denied bail. Police could not be reached at the time of publication. Daily News
