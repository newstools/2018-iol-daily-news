The payload took off early this morning on a Falcon 9 rocket from the 
Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.  Northrop Grumman, an American aerospace and defence technology company, acknowledged that it arranged the launch on the US government’s behalf and said the payload would be launched into a low-Earth orbit.  However, very little is known about the nature of the Zuma mission, as no US government agency has claimed responsibility for it so far.  SpaceX has already launched two classified payloads for the US government during the past year.           As usual, SpaceX once again landed Falcon 9’s first stage back to Earth during Sunday’s mission.  Such landings are part of SpaceX’s efforts to develop fully reusable rockets, which the company believes could bring down spaceflight costs.
