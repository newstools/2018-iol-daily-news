Lusiba, who matriculated with eight distinctions from Velabahleke High School in uMlazi, found out on Tuesday that his initial 67% for maths reflected on his NSC results sheet was actually 93%. Lusiba and his principal on Monday went to the Department of  Education offices at Truro House in Durban. “They (officials) wanted me to go through the remarking process, but those results would only come out in April. We had proof with us that 67% wasn’t my mark because I am a straight A student in maths.”  Lusiba said he was furious the officials had put his future in jeopardy. “They didn’t care about me or the bursaries I was declined. The institutions I applied to for actuarial science declined me because of the discrepancy.” Lusba said while officials had provided him with his true mark they didn’t account for it. Department spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa said last night he did not have all the details of the matter, but added that the relevant department officials would deal with it. Lusiba’s class and maths teacher, Thamsanqa Vezi, said this was not the first this had happened and it was a concern. “We had to send e-mails to the varsities concerned to ask them to give us some time to try to resolve this discrepancy.We are still faced with the task of convincing them,” he said. Vezi said Mvelo must now beg for university space and bursaries which he would have easily secured had this not happened. Daily News
