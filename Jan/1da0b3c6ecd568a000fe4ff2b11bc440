DA leader Mmusi Maimane is expected to lead a party delegation to the king’s palace on Sunday. Former president Kgalema Motlanthe led an investigation into the ownership of land in the country, and later recommended that the Ingonyama Trust Act should be scrapped. Maimane and other party leaders will be in KZN this weekend for Saturday’s provincial congress, which will see the election of new leaders. DA provincial leader Zwakele Mncwango, who is in the running for a second term as provincial leader, said Maimane and the new provincial leadership would tell the king they supported the trust. The trust governs traditional land on behalf of the king, but is facing being phased out following Motlanthe’s 2016 report that declared it unconstitutional. Mncwango said the government should review the trust and, if there were problematic clauses, amend it instead of scrapping it. He said that the politicians should engage the trust to find out how people could have title deeds to the land. Mncwango will only travel to Nongoma if he defeats eThekwini councillor Emmanuel Mhlongo, who is challenging him. Mhlongo has said he is also opposed to the scrapping of the trust. “It is the DA’s stance that the Ingonyama Trust should remain,” he said. Daily News
