With the results including those of progressed pupils (those who have failed Grade11 more than once or are too old for the grade), the province achieved a 72.8% pass rate, Angie Motshekga, the Minister of Basic Education, said when she released the results of the National Senior Certificate exam on television. The KZN results, with the progressed pupils excluded, stood at 73.6%, an increase of 4.1% from 2016. Motshekga praised the province for the extra support and intervention it had given to the region’s progressed pupils, who otherwise would have fallen through the cracks and eventually dropped out of the education system. Now, thanks to such interventions in KZN as well as Gauteng, the Free State and Mpumalanga, they had been given a second chance and had the golden opportunity to go to either university or TVET college. She called on other 
provinces to follow their lead and urged the 133 049 matric candidates across the country who did not make it, to register for the Second Chance 
programme. There were 107 430 registered progressed pupils in the Class of 2017, the second largest number since the policy was promulgated in 2013. Motshekga said the national matric pass rate, with progressed pupils included in the statistics, stood at 75.1%, which was a 2.6% improvement on the 2016 figure. “This represents a total of 401 435 candidates who had passed the 2017 NSC examinations,” she said, congratulating pupils. A total of 161 081 distinctions were achieved, an improvement of 1.8% from the previous year, and KZN pupils notched up the biggest tally with 28%, followed by Gauteng with 22.4%, Western Cape with 15.5%, Limpopo with 9.5%, and the Eastern Cape with 9%. “It is remarkable to note that the Eastern Cape, KZN and Limpopo produced a combined 46.5% of the total distinctions achieved nationally,” she said. When it came to the top 10 performing districts in their provinces, with the progressed pupils included, she said uMgungundlovu in KZN had achieved an 81.5% pass rate.  Referring to the progressed pupils, she said 18751 passed matric with a total of 1801distinctions, including in critical subjects such as accounting, business studies, economics, maths and physical science. Nearly 2 800 pupils with special education needs wrote the exam, up 42.8%, and 77.2% passed. Gauteng and KZN were congratulated for their combined contribution of bachelor passes of 80.2%, an increase of 3.5%. And 1956 distinctions were achieved. There was also “a remarkable shift” in the balance of forces, she said, referring to the results between the country’s no-fee schools and the fee-paying schools. The bachelor passes in no-fee schools stood at 76300, and 67867 in fee-paying schools, she said. “From 2015 to date, greater equity was observed despite the reality that inequalities still remain in the system the government must be applauded for its pro-poor policies the pro-poor funding of schools, the provision of nutritious meals and the provision of transport.” The results told the story - for every fee-paying school that achieved a 60% to 79.9% pass rate, there are more than five “no-fee” schools achieving at the same level. “The Education Department would be the first to concede that despite the notable improvements in the system, we are yet to cross our own Rubicon,” she said. “We must agree that much has been achieved, but much more needs to be done in the areas of efficiency and quality,” she concluded.
