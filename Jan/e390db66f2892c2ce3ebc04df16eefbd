Durban - At around noon on Monday, a third-floor window blew out of its frame smashing a Mercedes Benz on Gillespie Street in South Beach, Durban. It seems the occupants of the apartment at the DUT Baltimore Residence had left the window open since Durbanites woke up to a beautiful sunny Monday morning but by about 10 am strong winds had hit the city. The entire window frame blew out and landed on the rear windscreen of the Mercedes Benz parked below.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
