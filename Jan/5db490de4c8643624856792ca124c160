Durban - Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC said we can save lives by donating a pint of blood as the blood bank is only left with enough blood to last three days. Dhlomo was concerned about deaths at KwaZulu-Natal hospitals because of the blood shortage and felt the public can make a difference by donating blood to ensure this does not happen. On Wednesday, the MEC donated a pint of blood at a South African National Blood Service (SANBS) donor centre at uMlazi Mega City. “We often hear of a shortage of blood and that is always concerning because if there’s a shortage, then it means you can’t access blood from our hospitals. So, I’m here to give my contribution but also to plead with South Africans to consider donating a pint of blood.  “One pint of blood can help a pregnant woman who has bled too much, or a cancer patient who needs it, or someone who may be in an accident. So, it’s a gift of life and it’s a great thing because you’re giving it to someone you don’t even know and you yourself may need that blood tomorrow. It’s a good thing to do. In fact, it is Godly, because it’s about giving another person the precious gift of life. I would wish that nobody should die in a hospital just because we are short of blood. We all need to mitigate against that,” said Dhlomo. He said students, who are the main source of blood, are away on holidays and factories are closed, which means the SANBS has only enough blood to last just three days in the province.
