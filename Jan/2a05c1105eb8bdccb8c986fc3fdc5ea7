Durban - The KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo paid a surprise visit to Nkwali Clinic, in uMgababa, south coast of Durban and vowed to take action against staff after receiving a slew of complaints about the facility. Dhlomo had been made aware of a number of complaints such as poor staff attitude towards patients, the alleged turning away of patients with an emergency and nurses who do not respect time - some of these nurses had left work early during “Black Friday”. A local Inkosi had tipped off the MEC on the issues facing the clinic on Saturday and has led to the MEC taking action. LISTEN: MEC Dhlomo gives troubled clinic a surprise visit.

Secondly, we would like to thank the local community for the patience that they have shown by not resorting to taking the law into their own hands,” said Dhlomo. “This clinic falls under Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital. We will follow up on reports that have been sent to Prince Mshiyeni, have another meeting here, and concretise a plan and request eThekwini Ward 98 Councillor Thabethe to call a community meeting where I will, through him, report on our findings regarding this clinic,” he continued.
