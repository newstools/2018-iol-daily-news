Video: Zainul Dawood The early morning drama unfolded when one of the residents in Howell Road decided to find the source of a foul smell around his home. Popo Zungu, the next door neighbour, said he had been cleaning outside and inside his home but the smell would not go away. On Wednesday morning he saw hundreds of flies buzzing around the windows inside his neighbours home between the net curtain and window panes. The windows were closed and the doors were locked. Zungu had also not seen his neighbour, who lived alone, since December. Zungu said the woman had been evicted from her home in August but had come back unannounced. "Her phone went unanswered and I got concerned. After the evictions, some tenants returned to their homes but did not want to be seen. I am grateful that police assisted us to find out what was causing the smell and flies," he said.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
