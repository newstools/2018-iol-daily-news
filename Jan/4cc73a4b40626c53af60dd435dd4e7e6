Durban - Despite a robber being bitten on the forearm by a ferocious Pitbull name Catcher he continued to terrorise a family in Reservoir Hills on Tuesday. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a police spokesperson, said four men carrying firearms and knives entered the Varsity Drive home and robbed the family of cellphones, jewellery and cash. The robbers fled in their getaway vehicle. The homeowner, a prominent religious pundit, who declined to be named said the men pretended to look for accommodation. When the domestic worker came to the door they pointed a gun at her head and forced her to open the door. The pundit , his two sons and two of their guests were told to lay down on the floor. The men threatened to kill them unless they handed over cash and jewellery. The pundit said his phone rang during the ordeal. One of the robbers pulled the phone out of his pocket. The pundit then realised that the man was bleeding from a wound to his forearm. When the robbers left he found Catcher traumatised. He suspects the dog may have been beaten up. There were blood stains in the house and in the driveway. A case of house robbery was opened at Sydenham police station. Daily News
