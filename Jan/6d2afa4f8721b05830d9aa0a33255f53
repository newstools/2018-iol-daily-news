Durban - A Hillcrest-based hydroponic dagga lab was uncovered and two men nabbed for drug dealing following a sting operation by the Provincial Drug Task Team in Durban on Wednesday.  According to Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, police were led to the lab after arresting two men in Umbilo and Morningside. The first man was nabbed with packets of dagga.  “Further police investigation led the team to another man in Stephen Dlamini (Essenwood) Road.  “The second suspect was found with packets of dagga in his possession. He is suspected of supplying drugs to runners. Police recovered R18 000 from the suspect,” Zwane said.  It is alleged that when police questioned the man, he led them to a container in Molweni, Hillcrest. “At the container, police found the hydroponic dagga plants. The street value of recovered dagga laboratory is more than R400 000. Both suspects aged 33 and 43 were charged for dealing with drugs and will appear at the Durban and Pinetown Magistrates’ Court in due course,” Zwane said.  The arrests have been hailed by Major General Bheki Langa, KZN Acting Provincial Commissioner. “The vigilance and determination by the Drug Task Team members to eradicate drug trade in the province is commended. We will continue with these operations to root-out the spread of drugs in the streets and we will ensure that we arrest and send all criminals to court for prosecution,” Langa said.  Daily News
