Durban - A Durban business was gutted after a fire broke out at the premises in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Cellphones and accessories, worth thousands of Rands, were damaged at the shop in Bertha Mkhize (Victoria) Street. Garrith Jamieson of Rescue Care said the cause of the fire is unknown and there were no injuries. This incident is the latest in a spate of fires that have ravaged businesses in the Durban Central Business District and surrounds. Earlier this month, paramedics responded to two fires. On January 16, Jamieson said at least 15 vehicles were burnt in a fire at a business premises in Stalwart Simelane (Stanger) Street.  Hours later, teams rushed to the second fire in Khuzimpi Shezi  (Williams) Road in uMbilo. At both scenes, no injuries were reported. The Inner City Thekwini Regeneration and Urban Management Programme (iTrump) will be conducting inspections on these and other buildings identified in the CBD, to establish their compliance. Hoosen Moolla of iTrump said they will also look into illegal establishments at these buildings. “You find that these are commercial buildings and landlords put tenants in the buildings. This puts the lives of people at risk. It also endangers the lives of firemen who come out to attend to fires at these buildings, only to find residents living there,” he said. Moolla said they will continue their work in inspecting these buildings and urged landlords and building owners to ensure that their buildings are compliant with the city’s bylaws and safety regulations. In a separate incident, a fire broke out at the Blue Waters Hotel on north beach at the weekend. Guests had to be evacuated while fire crews battled the blaze. A woman was treated for smoke inhalation. In Queensburgh, a toddler was rescued from a burning house. The 17-month-old boy and his mother were transported to a nearby hospital for further care that they required. Daily News
