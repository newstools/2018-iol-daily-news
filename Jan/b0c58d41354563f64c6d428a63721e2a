A family friend told the Daily News they were also awaiting forensic results before planning Lee’s funeral. Claims have surfaced that Lee had been abducted because her mother owed R50 000 to a foreign national.

News of Lee’s abduction went viral on social media after she was allegedly taken by a man outside her workplace in Margaret Maytom Avenue in Durban North on January 4. Police have since released an identikit of the man they believe may have taken Lee. They are appealing for people with information to contact the Durban North SAPS at 031 560 8000. Meanwhile, tributes continue to pour in on Lee’s Facebook page. Daily News
