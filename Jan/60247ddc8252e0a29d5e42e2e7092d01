Durban - The South African Police Services in KwaMashu, a township north of Durban, have warned Uber and metered taxi drivers to be on high alert when driving in KwaMashu and surrounding areas. 
Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, police spokesperson, said the warning came after a number of robberies were reported where criminals would pretend to be clients and want to be fetched from restaurants, nightclubs or other places to their requested destination around the township. 
“Recently on December 31 at 10.15 pm, a 41-year-old driver was dropping a passenger in Ndlondo Road in G section who had paid a short fare and told the driver to wait for someone who will pay the full amount. All of a sudden a firearm was pointed at the complainant. They took cash as well as his two cell phones and fled the scene,” said Mbhele. 
“In the second incident on Monday January 1, at 11.20 pm, a 24-year-old driver was contacted to pick up a passenger from Phoenix destined to J section, KwaMashu. Upon arrival at the destination, a suspect ordered to be dropped and he pulled a firearm from his back and pointed it at him. The second suspect approached, they demanded his cell phone, took cash and then he was forced to get into the boot of the car,” continued Mbhele. 
She said charges of robbery are being investigated at KwaMashu SAPS.   Daily News
