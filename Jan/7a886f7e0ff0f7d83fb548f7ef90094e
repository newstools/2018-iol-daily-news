Police would not reveal who tipped them off, but according to the local paper, the South Coast Herald, a jogger was stopped during his run, shown the body, and he immediately reported it to the police.  Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, said the victim was burnt inside the toilet. They are trying to trace his next of kin.  Port Shepstone police are investigating a case of murder. Doug Rawlins, Ray Nkonyeni Municipality Ward 18 councillor, said the toilets were situated near the dilapidated Banana Express train station. Rawlins said this was a no-swimming beach and an underdeveloped area.  “About 300m away, the sliding pool has its own toilet and change-room facilities. The Banana Express building is due for an upgrade and a private developer should start work soon. All the toilets in use are maintained and close at 6pm,” Rawlins said.  He added that the beachfront had become popular on weekends during the past few years, but a lack of policing was a problem.  “The Ray Nkonyeni Municipality passed nuisance by-laws which will hopefully alleviate some of the problems,” he said.
