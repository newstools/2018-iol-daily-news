Siphosakhe Zulu, 41, told the commission investigating political killings in the province that tensions rose when his wife’s name moved from number two to number one on the ward councillor candidates’ list. Thembi Mbongo was one of four candidates for ward six in Madadeni, near Newcastle, who had been nominated by party members at a branch meeting. She was shot dead at her home, in front of her four children and husband, on July 3, 2016. Mbongo is one of at least 14 ANC ward candidates and party members in KwaZulu-Natal who were killed in the run-up to the August 2016 local government elections. “After a community meeting where shortlisted candidates answered questions from the community, the selection committee made their choice, taking into consideration the number of votes received by each candidate at a branch meeting and the response from the community,” Zulu explained. He told the commission his family became aware of the scale of the problem when a group of about 30 women from the area, some ANC members, marched to his home. “They made threats via ­placards saying they would prefer blood on the floor than her becoming a ward councillor, but they did not confront us,” he said. He said the family dismissed the threats as “just angry people, because their candidate lost the number one spot on the candidates’ list”. “I am certain my wife’s death was politically motivated and connected to the local government elections. Certain people were not happy with her nomination, but the community wanted her to lead,” he said. Zulu contested to fill the ward councillor’s position won posthumously by his wife in a by-election, and won. “We worked hard during that campaign, and although I lost my wife, I felt I had to continue from where she left,” he added. The inquiry continues. Daily News
