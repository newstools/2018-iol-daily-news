The dreadful smell coming from the bag left residents on Mainpark Way wondering if there was a dead body inside. Glen Naidoo, of private security company KZN VIP Unit, said when his response officers inspected the bag they found the decomposed carcass of a dog which had been cut into pieces and dumped outside a home on Mainpark. “A  black double cab was seen parked outside that home before the black bin bag appeared. We have informed police,” Naidoo said. Neeri Naidoo, of Phoenix Animal Care and Treatment (Pact), said she was appalled and was investigating the circumstances around it. “I demand justice for this dog. The persons who did this are sick and need to be removed from society. Today it may be a dog, but tomorrow it could be someone’s child, wife or mother,” Naidoo said. Daily News
