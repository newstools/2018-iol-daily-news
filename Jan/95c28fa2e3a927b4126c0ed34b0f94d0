On Friday, hundreds of EPWP workers embarked on a strike, demanding to be employed by the city on a full-time basis and demanding an increase in their R2 500-a-month  salary. During their strike, the EPWP workers allegedly trashed the city’s roads with rubbish, leaving a trail of destruction in the Durban inner city, and prevented employees from the Cleansing and Solid Waste Unit from cleaning the city. On Monday, the municipality gave all striking EPWP workers an ultimatum to report to work for the evening shift or risk having their contracts terminated. “Before the ultimatum was given to EPWP employees, the municipality had an extensive consultation with the employees on Sunday where they agreed to return to work with immediate effect,” eThekwini said. “However, they continued to embark on strike action, demanding full-time employment, while preventing some Cleaning and Solid Waste Unit employees from executing their duties.” The municipality added that the number of workers had been increased to ensure that the refuse removal backlog would be cleared by the end of the week.
