Durban - January 25. Payday for the majority of South Africans who if a recent Facebook poll by the Daily News is to be believed spent most of the month - after an expensive festive season - broke. Some saw the funny side of what has being termed #Januworry and took to social media just days into the New Year to ask how many more months were left in January. The Daily News ran a poll on their Facebook page and discovered that most of their readers were broke after a very expensive festive period. According to the poll on which asked if people were broke after December, 60 per cent of respondents said yes and the rest said no. Debt expert, Neil Roets had warned consumers about overspending over the Christmas holidays. “Unless you have budgeted for Christmas presents and New Year’s goodies, think twice about increasing your debt load,” said Roets. “While it is true that some retailers have great specials going on over the holiday season, the reality is that loans have to be repaid – mostly at very high interest rates – and there are substantial expenses waiting down the road in January and February in the form of school fees, university payments, school uniforms and much of the debt that had been stacked up in November.” Roets said that consumers should differentiate between their wants and their needs. The holidays are a time to buy what is required and put luxuries on hold for the future. Mellony Ramalho, African Bank’s Group Executive: Sales, Branch Network, said things such as bond repayments, rent, loans, school fees, municipal bills, medical aid, insurance and groceries can be overwhelming at the start of a new year. “Learning how to budget properly and sticking to a budget is a discipline that everyone should learn. A budget should make provision for the here and now, but also include room for future goals like retirement or education. How well you manage your money and payments now will determine your future financial wellbeing,” Ramalho said. Daily News
