Durban - EThekwini Municipality is working on a plan to address the backlog of waste in areas affected by the recent Extended Public Work Programme (EWP) strike.  Mandla Nsele, the city's deputy head of communications, said workers from the Cleaning and Solid Waste Unit will be collecting waste in areas where waste collection day is usually on a Wednesday.  "Once this is completed, they will work to address the backlog by collecting waste that had been scheduled to be collected on Monday and then proceed to collect waste that was due to be collected on Tuesday in affected areas," Nsele said.  Residents are encouraged to take their waste out even if their collection day has passed as staff will be working hard to address the backlog caused by the strike. Nsele said the public must note that EPWP workers contracted to the Outer West Region have embarked on strike action.  "Negotiations are ongoing to resolve the issue. Affected areas include Kloof, Cato Ridge, Monteseel, Hammarsdale, Gillitts, Hillcrest Centre, Crestholme and Inanda Road. Action is being taken with a contingency plan in place to address the backlog," he said.  Daily News
