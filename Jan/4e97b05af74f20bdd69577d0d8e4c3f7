Durban - A video, showing a pupil threatening to assault three fellow pupils at a local school has gone viral on social media. In the clip, a pupil is seen threatening three other youngsters. He then grabs one of the boys and pushes him to stand in between the other two. After a few seconds, he pushes his hand into the faces of the three boys. The video clip ends. Sihle Mlotshwa, spokesperson for the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education, said they have identified the school. He said the matter is under investigation by the uMlazi District. Mlotshwa said they are unsure when the video was taken. Meanwhile, another two similar videos have surfaced since the start of the 2018 school year. In one of the videos, two girls from a Sydenham high school are seeing arguing. Seconds later, the pair get into a physical fight in full view of fellow school pupils. The video was taken outside a house in the area. It is believed that the school has since called a meeting between the pupils and their parents. In another video, a pupil is seen throwing a brick at another pupil. “The Department is disturbed by these video. Bullying is a social ill that should have no place in our schools,” Mlotshwa said. In August last year, Lindokuhle Dube was arrested after a video of him slapping a female pupil at Siyathuthuka Secondary School in Inanda, went viral. Daily News
