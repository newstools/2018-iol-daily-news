Durban - The N3 Toll Concession (N3TC) has reported that there was a decrease in fatal crashes on the N3 Toll Route during the December 2017 holiday season. Con Roux, commercial manager of N3 Toll Concession said despite an overall increase in fatal crashes on the N3 Toll Route in 2017 (from 83 in 2016 to 119 in 2017), the N3TC has seen a slight improvement in the number of fatalities during the festive season. “Considering the fact that traffic increased exponentially in December, and poor weather conditions were experienced at times, the decrease in the number of fatalities on the N3 Toll Route is significant,” explained Roux. Roux said that they recorded only 12 fatal crashes in December with a total of 17 fatalities. Of all the fatal crashes, only one was a pedestrian fatality. During the 2016 festive season, 14 crashes were recorded, with 22 fatalities, which included six pedestrian fatalities. “Compared to 2016, this last year was marred by a high number of fatal incidents. During 2017, 165 people lost their lives compared to 111 in 2016. The number of pedestrian fatalities were also higher in 2017 at 35 compared to 29 in 2016. It is clear that people remain vulnerable on our roads. We must remain committed and unwavering in our joint efforts to improve road safety,” said Roux. Roux said that in 2015, the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), in partnership with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), reported that human casualty costs comprised 69,3 percent of the total road traffic crash cost of R142.95 billion. While fatal crashes accounted for 43.4 percent of the total cost. The report revealed that a fatal crash costs the country’s economy as much as R5.4 million, while a ‘damage only’ crash costs an average of R48 500. “N3TC remains concerned about the severity of crashes on the N3 Toll Route, which often involves only single vehicles. A recent single light vehicle crash appears to have been caused by a tyre blow-out which resulted in three fatalities. During the December holiday season, 18 public transport vehicles were involved in crashes. Considering that public transport vehicles carry the most precious goods – human lives – this high number is extremely disturbing,” said Roux. Main types of crashes recorded on the N3 Toll Route from January - December 2017 included: Vehicles leaving the road (26.1% of crashes) Vehicles rolling (22.3% of crashes) Head/Tail collisions, both moving and stationary vehicles (13.6% of crashes)  “N3TC wishes to extend its appreciation to the sterling efforts made by the emergency services, law enforcement officers and numerous volunteers throughout the holiday season to support and enhance safety on the N3 Toll Route. However, road safety cannot only be the responsibility of law enforcement- and road and traffic management agencies. Every driver and every passenger should make it their business to make our roads safe. High risk behaviour on our roads is totally unacceptable and civil society should not condone or tolerate this,” concluded Roux.  Daily News
