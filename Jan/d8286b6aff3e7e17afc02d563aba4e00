And this is because the luxury hotel and apartment group The Capital Hotels & Apartments has expanded its national presence and opened the new attraction at the Pearls of uMhlanga landmark development in the holiday resort. The Capital Pearls Resort Hotel, which is the fifth phase of The Pearls of uMhlanga, has direct access on to the main uMhanga Beach, and offers 140 apartments and extensive conference and meeting facilities for up to 200 delegates. The hotel also offers easy access to the swimming pool, bar, sundeck, more than 16 restaurants and a children’s play area, plus complimentary access to the development’s Planet Fitness Gym. The contemporary apartments are a mixture of executive suites, and one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, each including a modern, fully-equipped kitchen and living area. Having officially opened its doors last month, The Capital Pearls is the group’s eighth property in South Africa, and its first outside the major cities of Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town. “Our guests choose The Capital’s ­hotels and apartments across South Africa because we are 25% more affordable than other hotels of comparable size and quality,” said Marc Wachsberger, managing director of The Capital Hotels & Apartments. The Capital Pearls, along with all The Capital’s properties across the country, does not offer services such as porters, bedtime turndowns, sewing kits or unlimited toiletries. Instead, it is designed to make travellers’ stay more efficient and cost effective by offering free, uncapped high-speed internet, laundry services, secure parking and shuttle services. As well as being ideal for families, The Capital Pearls also offers a comprehensive solution for business travellers who seek a balance between the comfort of home and the luxury of resort living when they’re travelling for work.
