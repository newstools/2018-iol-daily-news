Durban - The body of a six-month-old baby girl was recovered from the Msunduzi River near Woodhouse Road in Pietermaritzburg after she was dumped earlier this week. Russel Meiring, ER24 spokesperson said ER24 paramedics, along with SAPS Search and Rescue and the K9 Unit, had received information that a child had been dumped by a woman earlier in the week. “A search by the SAPS Search and Rescue divers immediately began on Tuesday. Unfortunately, the search was called off but continued later on Wednesday,” said Meiring. “After several hours of searching, the body of a six-month-old girl was found. Unfortunately, the child had been dead for some time,” continued Meiring. Police were on scene and are investigating. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said a 19-year-old woman was arrested for the murder. “It is alleged that she threw her baby into the river and the body was retrieved by the Pietermaritzburg Search and Rescue Team,” said Zwane. He also said the woman will appear at the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on Friday facing a charge of murder. Daily News
