Omesh Ramnarain was believed to be the man behind the wheel of a black Golf GTi that crashed into two cyclists out for a morning ride in February 2016. Richard da Silva, 46, and Jared Dwyer, 36, died in the collision. Ramnarain pleaded not guilty to the charges of culpable homicide. Yesterday the first witness, James Murray, testified that he was the first person to arrive at the scene. Murray said Ramnarain and a passenger had got out of Ramnarain’s car and rushed over to another car where they drank lots of water. However, Ramnarain’s defence team, led by advocate Murray Pitman, argued that his client had gone across the highway to talk to his mother and did not drink water. After poking holes in Murray’s version of the crash, Pitman said he believed the witness’s recollection of events was unsatisfactory. Murray said he could smell alcohol when Ramnarain spoke to him. Ramnarain denied he was under the influence of alcohol when he crashed into Da Silva and Dwyer. Dressed in a silver-grey suit, Ramnarain appeared sullen as Pitman read his statement to Magistrate Anand Maharaj. Ramnarain’s family sat close together while the cyclists’ friends and family sat in the next row, listening intently to the statement. Ramnarain further claimed that he was not speeding. He claimed he had gone out to a popular nightclub and drank four ciders and while sitting at the bar, “other people had spilled their drinks on him”. The trial continues. Daily News
