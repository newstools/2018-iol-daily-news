Durban - The search for a man who allegedly drowned at Oslo Beach is set to resume on Monday. The 20-year-old man is believed to have gone swimming when he was swept out to see by rip currents. He was swimming with his brother at the time. Craig Lambinon, spokesperson for the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said despite and extensive sea and shoreline search, there was no sign of the missing man. “Police Search and Rescue will continue with an ongoing search operation,” he said. Closer to home, 12 crew members aboard a commercial fishing ski-boat had to be rescued after their vessel suffered motor mechanical failure, 10 nautical miles from the Port of Durban earlier in the day. “When rescue teams arrived, a tow-line was rigged and the vessel was towed to port without incident. Once safely in port, no further assistance was required. The skipper confirmed that he was confident he would make it back to the Fynnlands Angling Club unassisted and NSRI remained on alert until they reported to be safe at the Angling Club and no further assistance was required,” Lambinon said.
