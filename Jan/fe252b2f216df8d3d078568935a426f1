Linking Mount Edgecombe to the Cornubia business hub and other Cornubia businesses, the new interchange is also providing direct access to Cornubia for commuters travelling along the M41. The new bridge and interchange has effectively doubled the number of lanes crossing the M41 as well as enhancing access and egress to and from it. It has been designed to handle the increased traffic that will be attracted to the greater Cornubia development and specifically the business hub. This is the third bridge giving easy access into Cornubia, the others being the bridge over the N2 motorway, which connects Cornubia with the uMhlanga Ridge Town Centre, and the bridge over the railway line and MR79, giving access from the R102. “This key infrastructure development will prove invaluable to the businesses in Cornubia, such as MMI, where some 900 jobs have been created,” said Selemo Sefehle, project manager: business hub, uMhlanga Hills, Marshall Dam and Blackburn Village for Tongaat Hulett Developments. Travel times “The upgrade provides for increased access to these new precincts that will form part of the new greater Cornubia Development.” Travellers using Flanders Drive should now find that their travel times are improved because the new ramps and traffic signals should improve the traffic flow through the interchange. M41 travellers have become used to the significant back-up of traffic from the N2/Mount Edgecombe interchange around peak traffic times. Once the adjacent upgrade of the N2/Mount Edgecombe Interchange is completed, traffic congestion on the M41 will be eliminated. This R280 million project, which began in 2015, was co-funded by the eThekwini Municipality and Tongaat Hulett. Interchanges and on- and off- ramps to the M41 had to be cut and built for easy access to the retail centre from Phoenix and from the M4. Daily News
