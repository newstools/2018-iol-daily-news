Durban - Tongaat resident Thembinkosi Mdluli, 31, suffered serious injuries when he was pushed out of a moving vehicle between Compensation and Esenembe, Tongaat in KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday afternoon. Prem Balram, Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson, said Rusa officers were called out to the R614 after a passing motorist found Mdluli at the roadside. He was in need of medical assistance. “Reaction officers responded to the location and found that the victim had suffered extensive facial and bodily injuries. Paramedics were called out to the scene and treated the injured man,” he said. Balram said Mdluli told Rusa officers that he was thrown out of a grey Nissan Hardbody bakkie after he was given a lift from Tongaat to Magwaza, near Esenembe. Mdluli then explained that while in the bakkie, the driver asked him to pay for the lift.  “According to the victim, he informed the male driver that he did not have any cash. This angered the driver who instructed a passenger to push the victim out of the moving vehicle. The bakkie then fled the scene. A truck that was following the bakkie then ran over the victim. The truck driver failed to stop and render assistance,” said Balram. Daily News
