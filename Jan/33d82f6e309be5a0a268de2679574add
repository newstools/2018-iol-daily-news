This week, the Population and Immigration Authority called on migrants from Sudan and Eritrea to leave “to their country or to a third country”, meaning Rwanda or Uganda. Those who leave by the end of March will be given $3500 (R43 200), along with airfare and other incentives. The Hotline for Migrant Workers, an advocacy group, condemned the move, saying expulsions “put the refugees’ lives in danger”. Thousands of Africans entered Israel before it erected a fence along its border with Egypt. Many said they had fled conflict and persecution, and wanted refugee status. Israel has called them “infiltrators” and said they were mostly economic migrants whose numbers threatened its Jewish character. The BBC reported that if they did not leave, the Israeli authorities said they would start jailing them from April. The Israeli government said the refugees’ return would be humane and “voluntary”. According to the BBC, the order has exempted children, elderly people, and victims of slavery and human trafficking. Israel’s Population and Immigration Authority told the BBC there were currently 38 000 “infiltrators” in Israel, of whom just 1 420 were being held in detention facilities. The UN refugee agency said the controversial plan violated international and Israeli laws. ANA-AP
