Durban - Durban Metro Police, along with the South African Police Service and Road Traffic Inspectorate have increased patrols along key routes and bridges in KwaZulu-Natal, in a bid to stop rock throwing on bridges. This was implemented following reports of rocks and bricks being thrown at vehicles from overhead bridges. “As part of a more sustainable long-term solution to the problem, the City is looking at constructing steel cages over bridges, erecting closed-circuit television cameras and improving lights on bridges. This will be subject to normal Council procedures and availability of funding,” said Fawzia Peer, eThekwini Municipality Deputy Mayor. Tozi Mthethwa, eThekwini Municipality Head of Communications said that police believe the motive behind the rock throwing incidents is to hijack vehicles. “The modus operandi is that once a rock is thrown, the motorist is then forced to stop, after which, they may be attacked. Other possible motives are being investigated by the relevant law enforcement agencies,” said Mthethwa. Siblings Amina and Abdur Raheem Haffejee were killed when a large boulder was thrown on to their car. The boulder landed on the passenger side of the car, crushing Amina, who was in the front seat, and Abdur Raheem, who was seated behind her. The driver, Amina’s husband, was not injured. Mthethwa said more incidents were reported since then. “Metro Police have urged motorists to be observant when approaching bridges and not to stop under any circumstance, but rather to remain calm and drive to the nearest police station or service station from where they can call the police,” said Mthethwa. Mthethwa also said that suspicious activity can be reported to the Municipality’s Emergency Call Centre on 031 361 0000. Daily News
