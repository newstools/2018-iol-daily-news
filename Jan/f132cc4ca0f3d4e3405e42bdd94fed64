Durban - A group of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) stormed into Gateway, in a bid to protest outside the H&M clothing shop on Tuesday afternoon. The group managed to get into the mall after they were initially escorted out by mall security earlier in the day.

We are deeply sorry that the picture was taken, and we also regret the actual print. Therefore we have not only removed the image from our channels, but also the garment from our product offering,” said H&M spokesperson Amelia-May Woudstra. At the weekend, the EFF stormed a number of H&M stores in Johannesburg. AfriForum has since laid charges against the EFF for the protests. Daily News
