Luvuyo Mfaku, NPA spokesperson, confirmed that a meeting between the parties was taking place on Thursday but said he could not comment further or “pre-empt anything”. “There is a meeting but they might not be able to finalise anything in one day. We will only release a statement once the meetings have concluded.” The Assets Forfeiture Unit (AFU) is going after R50bn of South African taxpayers’ money believed to have been swallowed by dodgy dealings listed in the State of Capture report. Acting head of the AFU advocate Knorx Molelle said the unit was dealing with 17 cases and this was only the beginning of an onslaught of court orders to come. Earlier this week, the highly specialised team was granted a court order to freeze R1.6bn of assets from Gupta-linked companies McKinsey and Trillian. The R1.6bn is the same amount Eskom demanded the companies pay back last year. Eskom issued a letter of demand to the two firms last October for the repayment of the funds for an unlawful consultancy contract. Eskom said McKinsey received two unlawful payments totalling R1.028bn and Trillian, “with the consent of both McKinsey and Trillian” received four payments totalling R564.6m. These were raised as suspicious, based on information in the State of Capture report and subsequent Guptaleaks e-mails which pointed to alleged relationships between senior Eskom officials and the Gupta family. Gupta family associate Salim Essa was once a director of Trillian but has since resigned. But, McKinsey says they have been trying to return the money since October last year “because Eskom did not follow the appropriate procurement processes”. McKinsey’s director of External Relations Africa, Bonita Dordel, said they “will continue to co-operate with authorities and official investigations into these matters“. Daily News
