Durban - A man has died and another is in critical condition following another shooting at the notorious Glebelands Hostel in Durban’s Umlazi township on Sunday evening. Zanoxolo Qutha, 52, from Flagstaff in the Eastern Cape, succumbed to his injuries in hospital. Vanessa Burger, Independent Community Activist for Human Rights and Social Justice, said Qutha, a resident of Block R, was attacked in his vehicle while on the road, opposite Block M. Burger said that according to residents who ran to the scene of the incident, Qutha was shot at least three times, with one bullet entering the head. “A short while thereafter, while residents were trying to assist the victim, the attacker(s) returned and fired again, into the crowd, injuring a Block M resident,” said Burger. She said residents complained that police took a long time to respond, despite there being a newly opened satellite police station located ‘a few seconds away’. However, Umlazi SAPS and officers from a unit in Port Shepstone arrived at the scene first. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said, “The motive for the killing is unknown. Charges of murder and attempted murder were opened at Umlazi police station for investigation.” Daily News
