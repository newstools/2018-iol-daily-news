Netanyahu met the celebrities at a gala “Shalom Bollywood” on Thursday evening. Amitabh Bachchan, Karan Johar, Madhur Bhandarkar, Vivek Oberoi, Abhishek Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan, Subhash Ghai, Imtiaz Ali, Prasoon Joshi, Randhir Kapoor, Ronnie Screwvala, Raj Nayak and Sara Ali Khan were among some of the big names from the film fraternity. Karan tweeted a series of photographs of himself with Netanyahu, saying: “A complete honour and privilege to meet with the honourable Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu Such a wonderful evening with friends of the fraternity.” Bhandarkar said it was “great” attending the presentation on history, culture and geodiversity of Israel along with the film fraternity and had “pleasure interacting with Honourable Prime Minister of Israel Netanyahu and the first lady”. Vivek said it was an “incredible pleasure” to meet Netanyahu, who welcomed Bollywood to feature Israel’s natural beauty in its movies. “You are an amazing ambassador for Israel, you won our hearts! Looking forward to visiting your beautiful country and experiencing the rich Israeli culture very soon,” Vivek tweeted. Ghai was touched by the “delightful scene” when Netanyahu invited celebrities for a selfie and Amitabh helped him to take the selfie. “A pleasant evening indeed,” he said, adding that he was glad the master of ceremony, Mandira Bedi, did not use the word “Bollywood” in her speech, nor did Amitabh while welcoming Netanyahu. Netanyahu shared a photograph on his Twitter page, writing: “Will my Bollywood selfie beat Hollywood selfie at the Oscars?” To that, Modi wrote: “Wonderful bonding, Prime Minister!” IANS
