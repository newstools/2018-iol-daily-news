The incident happened at Fraser, near oThongathi. The 29-year-old man had been driving along the R102 when his bakkie veered off the road.  IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Paul Herbst said the bakkie rolled several times down a bank.  “The bakkie came to rest in thick brush in a roadside ditch and, from what we can gather, the man had tried to climb out of the car when he came into contact with a live illegal electricity connection,” Herbst said. The man was electrocuted and died at the scene.  Herbst said a woman passenger was trapped in the crumpled wreckage of the vehicle. “Medics had to wait for Eskom technicians to isolate nearby transformers. Once the connections were shut off, IPSS paramedics made their way to the woman.  "She was treated and stabilised in the vehicle before she was carefully extricated by members of the fire department, using the Jaws of Life,” he said.  KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of culpable homicide was opened at the oThongathi police station. Daily News
