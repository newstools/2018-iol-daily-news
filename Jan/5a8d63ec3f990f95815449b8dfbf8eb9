Durban - The body of a 30-year-old woman was recovered in the dense bushy area of Ndwedwe on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast on Wednesday. It is alleged that the woman had gone to collect herbs from the side of a cliff when she lost her footing and fell over. Paul Herbst, of IPSS Medical Rescue, said rescuers used climbing equipment to climb up the the steep cliff to reach the body. “Specialised high angle equipment and systems were established to lower the body to level ground. The body was then carried, with the help of the locals, for approximately 5km to an exit point,” Herbst said. In a separate incident, 14 people were rushed to hospital after two minibus taxis collided in the Durban Central Business District on Wednesday evening. Garrith Jamieson, spokesperson for Rescue Care, said more ambulances were dispatched to assist with the multiple patients on the scene. He said police were investigating the cause of the crash.
