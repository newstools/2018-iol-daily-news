Durban - Yet another ANC official has been killed in KwaZulu-Natal. Sifiso Mlambo, 34, a branch secretary at Empembeni area was assassinated while delivering some building material in the neighbourhood, Tholi Gwala, ANC Musa Dladla Regional Secretary said. Gwala said that while details surrounding Mlamambo's murder were sketchy, it appeared that a gunman who had been following him in a car opened fire on him. "At his age, Mlambo had managed to gain the trust of his community and was elected as a member of the traditional council in the Dube clan," Gwala said. "He is also a traditional trust member that services the community in the clan. The ANC is horrified of losing such dedicated, talented a young comrade who spent most of his time servicing his community. The passing away of  Mlambo will leave a void in the ranks of the ANC that will not be easy to fill. To many of us, Mlambo was an activist that loved the ANC and prepared to go an extra mile to serve his organisation with high degree. His killers have robbed the ANC and the community a dedicated leader and outstanding young comrade with amazing skills needed to serve our people," she said. The ANC called on anyone with information on the murder to assist the police. Mlambo's murder comes the Moerane Commission of Inquiry investigating political killings in KwaZulu-Natal continues.
