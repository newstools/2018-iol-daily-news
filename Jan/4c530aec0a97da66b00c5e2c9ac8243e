Durban - Six youngsters were taken in for questioning over rock throwing incidents along the N2 north. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, confirmed that police had rounded up six 15-year-olds who were found in the vicinity of the bridge, situated between Ballito and Tongaat. “We can confirm that they were not arrested but merely taken in for questioning. After being interviewed by police, they were released. The matter is still under investigation,” he said.  This is the closest police have come to a possible breakthrough into the incidents which have claimed the lives of two siblings and left at least four others injured. Last month, Amina and Abdur Raheem Haffejee were killed after a large rock landed on their vehicle that they were travelling in. Amina’s husband was driving the car and managed to drive to a local hospital where the two were pronounced dead. At the weekend, there was another report of a rock thrown onto a vehicle, in the same area. The driver escaped with only minor injuries.  A task team has been set up to probe the incidents. Fawzia Peer, eThekwini Municipality Deputy Mayor said they are looking into safety barriers and closed-circuit cameras be installed over bridges in hotspot areas. “We are investigating the possibility of installing safety barriers in the form of steel cages to prevent objects being thrown from overhead bridges,” Peer said.
