Durban - The fight for the land under traditional leadership is gaining traction with the Eastern Cape traditional leaders throwing their weight behind their KwaZulu-Natal counterparts. The traditional leaders are against former President Kgalema Motlanthe’s report and recommendations to relieve Ingonyama Trust ownership of land in the Zulu kingdom, and that the trust should be repealed. The Daily News reported this week that the report, compiled by a high-level panel lead by Motlanthe had declared Ingonyama Trust Act unconstitutional and had no contribution towards nation building. ILanga newspaper reported that Xhosa King Zwelonke Sigcau’s kingdom would support the Zulu kingdom in the fight against the commission’s recommendation. Sigcau’s spokesperson inkosi Xolile Ndevu said even if the Zulu kingdom decided to march, the Xhosa traditional leaders would be part of that march. “Even though we don’t have a structure like Ingonyama Trust this report affects us too. Our view is that the land must be given back to the Kings so that each can distribute such to their people,” Ndevu reportedly said. Abathembu kingdom spokesperson Dumisani Mgudlwa said the whole issue was political. “We will, however, wait until the Zulu kingdom consult us as this is an issue of a particular kingdom. It is only upon such consultation that we will get involved,” he told the Daily News. At the weekend, King Goodwill Zwelithini issued a stern warning to the ANC-led government saying all hell would break loose should it dismantle the Ingonyama Trust. The Mercury reported King Zwelithini as saying: "Those saying land should be taken away from me should come forward so we can show them who we really are as Zulus,” said the king. KwaZulu-Natal house of traditional leaders is currently locked in a meeting in Pietermaritzburg discussing the report and its ramifications. Daily News
