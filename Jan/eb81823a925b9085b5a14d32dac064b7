Howell Road resident Goodman Ntembele’s Nissan Juke was damaged and a home owner, Trentlyn Edwards, had to foot the bill to repair damages to his window when the SUV crashed into his home.  Ntembele, a truck driver, said he had parked his vehicle outside his home at 9.30pm on Tuesday. He was awoken by neighbours yesterday morning who told him his car was on its roof at the bottom of an embankment. Ntembele said he found pieces of glass on the road where he had parked, giving him the impression that thieves had broken a window and got inside the car.  “The thieves must have lost control of the car. They must have tried to kickstart it, but the steering locked,” Ntembele said.  The car crashed into Edwards’ lounge window, damaging the panes and burglar guards and bending the framework.    “I heard a loud bang and footsteps and shuffling noises outside. When I investigated, I found the overturned vehicle in my yard. I could not see anyone on the road,” Edwards said.  The Sydenham police have filed an accident report. Daily News
