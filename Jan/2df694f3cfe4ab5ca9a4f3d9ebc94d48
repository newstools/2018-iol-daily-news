Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, confirmed the arrest. Lee was taken from outside her workplace in Margaret Maytom earlier this month. Last week, it emerged that a farmer driving in a secluded area in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, had stumbled across the burnt remains of a young woman. At the time, reports claimed that the body was identified to be that of Lee. It is believed that the body was identified as Lee’s by a family member who accompanied police to the scene. However, according to sources close to the investigation, police are awaiting DNA results before they can officially confirm that the body belongs to Lee. Daily News
