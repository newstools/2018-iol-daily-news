Bongani Bongumusa, 29, was remanded into police custody after a brief appearance in the Verulam Magistrateâ€™s Court on Tuesday. He faces two counts of murder and is expected back in court next Monday. Bongumusa is alleged to have stabbed and then buried his girlfriend, Nelisiwe Ntuli, 23, and her 6-year-old daughter, Snothile, in a shallow grave near Tongaat Beach.   They were both from Maphumulo near KwaDukuza. Zakhele Ndlovu, 48, a resident, had alerted the police when he saw blood stains on the pathway between Park Avenue and the M4 north, which led him to a heap of sand. Police are still investigating if they were buried alive or had died of their wounds before being buried in bushes alongside a farm near the M4 north in Desainagar. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said investigations were ongoing. Daily News
