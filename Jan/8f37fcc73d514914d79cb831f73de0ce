They gained entry onto the premises and forced open the garage door when the resident attempted to close it,” he said. “They threatened to kill her if she did not comply and then proceeded to tie her up with a piece of cloth and forced open the front door of the house where they ransacked the bedrooms. The domestic worker managed to run out of the property and alert the neighbours,” Mathios said. “The gang dismounted a television and left it behind and fled with cash and a cellphone,” he said. Mathios said it was unclear what else was stolen during the robberies at this stage. Westville police attended the scene of the crime. Daily News
