Durban - A search has been launched for residents who may have come into contact with an injured dog in Gillitts, west of Durban this week, after the canine tested positive for rabies. It is believed that the dog was struck by a car on Wednesday afternoon, on Old Main Road, outside the Gillitts fire station. Tracey Lynch of the Gillitts Park Neighbourhood Watch, said two ladies spotted the dog and got out of their car to render assistance. “The dog nipped the two ladies who tried to catch it. Firemen from the station also tried to help and the local vet arrived. The dog was eventually caught and taken to the vet. It was very aggressive and looked like its jaw had been broken,” Lynch said. She said on Thursday morning the dog was found biting the bars of the cage it was in and was aggressive. “The dog displayed the symptoms of rabies. One can only test for rabies once the animal has been put down. The dog was euthanised and the state vet confirmed that he was infected with rabies,” Lynch said. The two women who were attacked by the dog have since been identified and are receiving treatment. Lynch said they are appealing to other residents who may have come into contact with the dog, to seek urgent medical attention. According to the Kloof and Highway SPCA, rabies vaccinations need to be done annually to ensure the vaccine remains effective, and thereby not only protects your four-legged companions but also your immediate family and community. In August last year, a two-year-old girl died after being bitten by a rabid dog in the Ilembe District. Daily News
