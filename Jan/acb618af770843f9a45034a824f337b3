Durban - The team involved in a massive search for a missing Durban woman have confirmed that the charred remains found in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands on Thursday, belonged to Siam Lee. Her body was identified by family members.  Lee, 20, was allegedly abducted from outside her work place in Margaret Maytom Avenue on January 4. Although details remain sketchy, it is alleged that Lee got into an altercation with a man outside her place of work on the day. The alarm was raised when Lee did not return home that evening. She was reportedly pushed into a vehicle with GP registration plates.  It is believed that a farmer, driving in a secluded area in the Midlands, made the gruesome discovery.  Mike Myers of Mobi Claw, one of the teams involved in the search for Lee, said they believed Lee was a victim of circumstance.  "May she rest in peace. This has been a very complex investigation that lead in so many directions, taking us into the dark underworld. A massive team effort was launched from the get go to try and find her," he said.   Meanwhile, tributes have been pouring on social media. Sue Foster, a family friend, declined to comment to the media.
