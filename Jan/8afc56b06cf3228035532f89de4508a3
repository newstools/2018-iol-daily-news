Durban - Granny Mouse Country House & Spa in the Midlands has started the year on a high, having won two awards. First the hotel won the “Most Relaxing Country Retreat in KZN” title in the LUX Tourism Awards, and now the general manager Sean Granger has just heard that it has been awarded the “Affordable Luxury Hotel of the Year Award for KZN” by the prestigious “The Luxury Travel Guide.” It is the second year in a row that the hotel has received an award from the travel guide, the first being for “Excellence in Service.” A delighted Granger said the travel guide awards represent the pinnacle of hospitality achievement and he was particularly thrilled winning the title as the competition was tough. “We will now take our place in the awards winners’ guide which will be distributed to more than 500 000 people worldwide,” he said.
