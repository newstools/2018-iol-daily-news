Sue Laubscher, a community activist, started the petition soon after two people were killed when a boulder landed on the vehicle that they were in. After the deaths of siblings Amina and Abdur Raheem Haffejee last month, there has been a widespread outcry for the eThekwini Municipality and the police to step in, and step up patrols, on pedestrian bridges. There have been several rock-throwing attacks across the city since the deaths. Earlier this week, a woman was left shaken after a rock landed on her windscreen on the N3 between the Tollgate bridge and the off-ramp to Warwick Triangle. Laubscher said signing the petition - Lets Stop Bridge Violence, which has already amassed more than 9000 signatures - shows that residents stand behind the need for bridge safety measures to be taken to a higher level. “We want to present the petition to local government and Parliament for awareness to grow,” Laubscher said. An anti-rock-throwing campaign is expected to be launched on Saturday at the Old Durban Drive-In site at 2pm. The motorcade will travel to oThongathi at 3pm. Zain Soosiwala, of eThekwini Secure, said the awareness campaign, in partnership with Abantu Abahlangene Against Crime, would be led by the eThekwini Central Cluster Community Police Forum and the SAPS and metro police. Meanwhile, two suspected rock throwers have been remanded after they appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Captain Nqobile Gwala, police spokesperson, said: “The suspects were spotted leaning over the Queen Nandi Drive-Inanda Road bridge carrying a rock. When police pounced on them, they were found in possession of a knife and gloves.” The pair, aged 23 and 25, are expected back in court next week. Daily News
