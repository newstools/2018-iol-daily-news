Durban - A gang member was accidentally shot in the neck by his fleeing accomplices and subsequently stoned to death following an armed robbery in Verulam on Monday night. It is alleged that a group of armed men had gone into a tuck shop in Hazelmere Road where they robbed the business owner. Two residents walked into the tuck shop during the robbery and when they noticed what was unfolding inside the shop, they turned to flee. Prem Balram of Reaction Unit SA (Rusa) said the armed robbers fired at the residents. “One person was shot in the arm while the second was shot in the buttocks. The two managed to drive to the Rusa offices and told officers what had just happened. “Paramedics treated them for their injuries before transporting them to hospital. Reaction Officers proceeded to the location of the shooting and found that the suspect had died at the scene. It is alleged that he was seriously injured after he was accidentally shot in the neck by his accomplices who fled the scene shortly after the shooting. The community then stoned the critically injured suspect to death,” Balram said. A 9mm with an extended magazine containing live ammunition was found near the deceased. Several 9mm spent cartridges were also recovered at the scene. Balram said Rusa officers searched for the remaining gang members however no arrests were made. Daily News
