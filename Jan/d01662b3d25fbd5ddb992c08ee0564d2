Durban - The dismembered bodies of a woman and her son were found in a deep, fresh grave in the Esidakeni area near Mandini, along the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal. KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, strongly condemned the killing of Zoe Buthelezi,49, and her son, Mthunzi Zulu,19. “Our detectives will work around the clock in making sure that the suspect allegedly involved in this brutal killing is brought to book and face the full might of the law. We also appeal to people to resolve their differences peacefully rather than involved themselves in fighting which lead to killings,” said Langa. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, provincial police spokesperson, said police were called to attend to a report about a missing woman and her son at Esidakeni after community members had become suspicious as they had last seen the victims on Tuesday, after an argument with a family member in the house. Zwane said police started their investigation on Saturday and searched for the missing woman and her son with the community’s assistance. “While they were at a relative’s house who was last seen with the victims, the (SAPS) members saw a fresh grave and they became suspicious. The members and the community started to dig the said grave and to their surprise, they found the bodies of the two missing people. The body of a woman was chopped into pieces and wrapped in plastic,” explained Zwane. He said two counts of murder are being investigated by Nyoni Police Station. The relative suspected of the murder is still at large. “We are appealing to anyone who might have information about his whereabouts to provide information the police or our Crime Stop number 0860 010 111,” said Zwane.
