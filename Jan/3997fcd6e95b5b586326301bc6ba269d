Durban - Eleven days into a strike for better pay and Durban University of Technology employees have vowed not to back down. On Monday,  irate employees sang and chanted anti-management slogans at the university’s Steve Biko campus while union representatives addressed the media in the boardroom. The bone of contention is the management’s refusal to meet employees “half-way” during salary negotiations. The unions, National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu), Tertiary Education National Union of South Africa (Tenusa) and the National Tertiary  Education Union (NTEU) embarked on a strike demanding a 10 percent salary increase. The university offered 6 per cent. Milton Estrice, spokesperson for the crisis management committee and Nehawu representative, said the 10 percent was affordable according to their calculations. “Management is not willing to negotiate with us and we are saying the strike will continue. They probably thought we were going to burn out and return to work. Staff members are united in that the strike will only stop once management starts to speak to the workers’ demands,” Estrice said. He said employees deserved the increase because the staff to student ratio was higher than the national standard, meaning that DUTs employees worked harder. “We are saying the institution has the means and is capable of meeting the employee demands. It’s quite evident that if you have 70 to 80 percent of your staff on strike, then there would be disruption in some of the units within the institution and that will mean certain tasks are not performed to standard. This can be resolved but the management has decided to take a tough line,” he said. Daily News
