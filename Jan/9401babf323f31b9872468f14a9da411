EFF MPL Vusi Khoza said they were surprised by the tight security there on Tuesday. The party had planned to storm the store in protest against the company’s campaign for their Squeeze clothing line featuring a black boy wearing a “Coolest monkey in the jungle” hooded jacket. “Security was very tight when our members got there, and we don’t know how they knew that we were coming. We are not intimidated, though, because we have made it clear in other provinces of what needs to be done to racists. We are happy because the fact that they have closed their shop in Gateway is an indication that they are taking us seriously. Blacks must be respected. Yes the white men took our land, but they can’t take our dignity. Racism must fall,” Khoza told the Daily News on Tuesday. He said he did not know what would have happened had they gained access to the shop. “That would have been guided by the reception by management. We are going to strategise and go back. They were very lucky that they got wind we were coming and closed their shop,” he said. A number of H&M stores in various parts of Johannesburg were vandalised by EFF members, even after the company apologised for the offending advert. Daily News
