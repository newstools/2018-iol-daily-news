Durban - The eThekwini Municipality has planned multiple road closures that will affect residents and road users in February. Kenneth Kaunda Road (between Athlone Drive and Humber Crescent) will be temporarily closed on 18 February 2018 between 7am and 10 am. “The closure will allow for a monitoring survey of the bridge in the area by the Engineering Unit, Surveying and Land Information Department,” said Tozi Mthethwa, eThekwini Head of Communications. Detours: • Southbound traffic will be diverted at Humber Crescent and rerouted towards riverside road via Tyne Place or Soofie Saheb Drive. • Northbound traffic will be diverted at Athlone Drive and rerouted towards Riverside Road via the M4. Mthethwa appealed to motorists to exercise extreme caution while travelling on the road, to obey speed limits, fasten their seat belts, not to drive under the influence of alcohol, ensuring that their vehicle is roadworthy and to be patient with other road users.  For more information please contact Merylene Naidoo on 031 311 7265 and Sharlene Naidoo on 031 311 7236.  The next day, Kenville Road will be closed for upgrades. “The public is urged to be aware that Kenville Road will be closed to the public from 19 February 2018 until 30 April 2019. This is in order to accommodate the realignment of Inanda Road and the construction of a new bridge along Kenville Road,” said Mthethwa. Mthethwa said that the affected part of the road will be between Sea Cow Lake and 37 Kenville Road. The road will be closed permanently to the public during the upgrades and will only be accessible to construction vehicles. “However, the public will still be able to access a portion of Kenville Road through Smithfield and Kew roads. Services, including water, sewer, electricity, storm water, Neotel and Telkom, may be affected as a result,” Mthethwa said. Daily News
