Durban - There was a decrease in the number of people killed on KwaZulu-Natal roads this past festive season compared to previous years, new figures from the transport department revealed. According to the festive season report released by Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi, there was a 10 percent decrease in road fatalities during 2017 festive season. Reacting to the report,  KZN Transport, Community Safety MEC, Mxolisi Kaunda said the preliminary statistics, which covered the period between 1 December 2017 to 15 January 2018, indicated that the number of road crashes declined by 6 percent nationally from 1 480 in 2016/17 to 1 391 in 2017/18. Road fatalities have also declined by 11 percent nationally from 1 875 in 2016/17 to 1 676 in 2017/17. In 2017, the province recorded 311 crashes against 279 this year. With regards to road fatalities this year, KwaZulu-Natal recorded 324 compared to 361 last year. Kaunda attributed the decline to intensive multi-disciplinary roadblocks the province conducted throughout the festive season and strong collaboration between government, civil society, business and the media in reinforcing road safety messages. He praised the law enforcement agencies for “closing ranks” in all hazardous areas in the province to ensure the reduction of crashes. However, Kaunda remained concerned that light motor vehicles contributed 49 percent of road crashes. “We are pleased that there was a significant decline of nine percent in the number of road crashes involving public transport modes, which include buses and minibus taxis,” Kaunda said. He noted that eThekwini was amongst the areas in the country, which recorded a disturbing increase in fatal crashes. “Speed also remains a major cause for concern since we still have motorists who are driving at above 220 kilometres per hour,” he said.
