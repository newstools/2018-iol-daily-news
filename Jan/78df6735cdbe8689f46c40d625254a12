A small group of aggrieved ANC members protested in front of the ANC’s provincial office in Durban on Monday. Among their complaints was that  leaders of the branches were elected through gatekeeping, which favoured 
suspended provincial executive committee chairperson Sihle Zikalala. “We don’t recognise branch leadership because those branches were launched without everyone involved. Three months is too short to solve the problems we are facing in the ANC,” said Mthunzi Dlamini, who led the protest. Before addressing protesters, Dlamini had a meeting with Zikalala, the co-ordinator of the provincial task team (PTT), and former economic development MEC Mike Mabuyakhulu, the convener. Protesters said the provincial task team formed by the national executive committee (NEC) was not balanced in its composition and they did not trust it would organise a free and fair conference. Branch leaders are responsible for organising meetings to nominate candidates for conferences and to send delegates to vote for leaders. Zikalala said the time frame would be addressed with the NEC.  He said the provincial task team would ensure it used the three months to ensure no member of the ANC was excluded from processes. “We will seek to ensure that we work for unity of the ANC, by fulfilling all stages towards the conference in a manner that is inclusive, transparent, builds unity and restores the integrity of the ANC,” Zikalala said. Mabuyakhulu said while it was understandable that party members would sing and praise their president, they should not isolate other comrades as “(Cyril) Ramaphosa is the ANC president, and not the president of the few”. “He is not owned by a particular faction, but he is owned by all members of the ANC as he belongs to the ANC as a whole,” said Mabuyakhulu.
