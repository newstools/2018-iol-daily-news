EFF members have protested at various shops across the country since Saturday, vandalising some. The protests started after an advertisement by the international clothing company showing a black child in a green hoodie with the words “Coolest Monkey in the Jungle” inscribed on it, which caused worldwide outrage on social media and other platforms. “Protests will continue until they come to the table, and they have not done that,” said spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. Meanwhile, the Swedish retailer said its efforts towards diversity and inclusiveness were genuine. “We are reaching out to gather ideas, feedback, comments and observations from our staff, critics, experts, influencers and business partners. We are open to constructive thoughts to help us create a better future,” it said. H&M had apologised and removed the controversial image when the protests began. “We got things wrong and we are deeply sorry. The recent incident was entirely unintentional but it demonstrates clearly how big our responsibility is as a global brand and how sensitive and mindful we need to be about different cultures and particularly about issues of race,” the statement read. Ndlozi previously called for tough consequences against "racists", saying an apology was not enough. “People were racists, there must be consequences like some form of punishment for anti-black racists, either they must shut down, go to prison or receive some form of punishment,” he said. The company said the week has been challenging for it, but added it remained fully committed to its South African operations. Daily News
