Durban - A policeman, implicated in the murder of a man in uMbilo last week, has been remanded back into custody pending his next court appearance. Constable Austine Lusheono Reynold and Brinley Levi Barlow made their first appearance in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Monday. The courtroom was filled with the deceased's friends and acquaintances. Many had to stand as there was no place to sit. Foreign media also filed into court to capture a glimpse of the accused. Moses Dlamini, spokesperson for the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) said a case of murder and two counts of armed robbery were under investigation. It is alleged that the suspects went to a house in uMbilo last week. “A problem arose and the police shot the deceased once in the face. The suspects, prior to the shooting, allegedly robbed two prostitutes in the uMbilo area and used the money to buy drugs from the same house where they shot the man,” Dlamini said. He said the matter was handed over to the Ipid. “Through intense investigations, our officers were able to arrest the police official who is stationed at SAPS Mpumalanga and the civilian who is unemployed,” Dlamini said. They are due back in court next week for their bail application. Daily News
