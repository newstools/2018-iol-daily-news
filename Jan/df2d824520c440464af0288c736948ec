Durban - The eThekwini Municipality has encouraged residents to use water sparingly, especially in the outer west areas (including Kloof, Valley of a 1000 Hills, Bothas Hill, Inchanga, Cliffdale, Drummond, Mandlakazi and Summerveld). 
“This is as a result of the lower than normal supply of water to these areas. An investigation is currently underway to determine the reason for the decreased supply from Umgeni Water Services,” said Mandla Nsele, eThekwini Municipality’s deputy head of communications. 
Nsele said as the city experiences high temperatures, there is a higher demand for water and as a result, residents are encouraged to ensure they utilise water responsibly. 
Residents are encouraged to report water leaks on toll free number 0801313013, or e-mail Eservices@durban.gov.za and WhatsApp 0731483477
