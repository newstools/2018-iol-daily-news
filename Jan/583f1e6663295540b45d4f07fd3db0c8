Prayuth Chan-ocha then turned on his heel and walked off, leaving the mock-up behind, to bemused looks and awkward laughter from the Government House press pack. The prime minister had briefly spoken to the media after attending an event promoting Children’s Day, but deployed his dodging tactic before anyone could ask him about a number of pressing political issues. “If you want to ask any questions on politics or conflict,” he said, “ask this guy.” It isn’t the first time Prayuth - a general who seized power in a bloodless coup in 2014 - has dumbfounded the media. In the past he has fondled the ear of a sound technician, flung a banana peel at cameramen, and threatened to execute any journalist who criticised his government. When it took power, his government enjoyed strong public support for ending a prolonged period of often-violent street politics. But criticism of its repressive policies and lack of transparency has grown. AP/African News Agency (ANA)
