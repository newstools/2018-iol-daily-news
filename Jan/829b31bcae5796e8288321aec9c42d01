It is believed that Nunkumar, eThekwini Inner South cluster commander, was suspended last month after an internal inquiry into claims of corruption.  A source claimed Nunkumar was fraudulently signing off on tenders.  “He was not authorised to sign off tenders. In order to do so, he would need a letter stating his authorisation and he made up the letter. So supply chain management was unaware that he was doing this fraudulently,” the source claimed.  In a report, published by the Sunday Tribune, a letter signed by Major-General Bheki Langa, acting KwaZulu-Natal police commissioner, confirmed that another high-ranking police official, Major-General Mandlenkosi Chirwa, was to replace Nunkumar “with immediate effect”.  Nunkumar is allegedly under investigation after claims of corruption, malpractice and maladministration.  He was reportedly charged with contravening the SAPS treasury regulations and fraud. Brigadier Jay Naicker, provincial police spokesperson, said he could confirm that an 
internal inquiry was initiated and that the process was ongoing.  He declined to comment on when the inquiry was launched or confirm if there was truth to rumours that Nunkumar had been suspended.  “We cannot comment further as this process remains a matter between the employee and employer,” Naicker said.  In February last year, Nunkumar received a medal for 30years of police service.  After two years of studying to be a teacher, Nunkumar followed in the footsteps of his older brother and joined the police force in 1985. In July 1986, Nunkumar worked as a constable. Within a month, he was promoted to sergeant.  Nunkumar moved up the ranks, and by 2009 he was appointed the cluster commander for the eThekwini Inner South.  This meant he was in charge of 10 police stations and three specialised police units.  Daily News
