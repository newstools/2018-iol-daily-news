Phoenix resident Shivar Maharaj had misplaced his wallet at a store in Mount Edgecombe and by the time he realised he left it on the shop counter it was gone. The wallet not only contained credit cards and his licence but his late mother's ashes. While the other items are easily replaceable, Maharaj is devastated that the thief made off with his mother's ashes just days before he was about to perform a 40-day commemoration prayer for her.Since Saturday Maharaj launched his own investigation, checking CCTV cameras in the store and parking lot. He believes he has zoned in on a possible person who might have picked up his wallet and has members of the Phoenix Crime Watch page for help. "I stopped at the petrol station to fuel up only to realise I left my wallet behind. Team Syndicate a local security company checked around the shopping centre including the bins but we could not find anything.  I had to do a special prayer with the ashes daily. My mothers 40-day prayer will be on Wednesday," Maharaj pleaded. The story got mixed reaction from Phoenix residents on Facebook`s Phoenix Crime Watch page.
