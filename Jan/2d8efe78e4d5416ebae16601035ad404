Durban - It has been a dry start to the New Year for Port Shepstone residents as taps continue to dry up due to erratic water supply.  On Tuesday, the Ugu District Municipality Water Services management sent out a Facebook post stating that they were replacing new pipelines and valves on some of their ageing pipeline infrastructures.  This has led to the water supply being shut down from 10 am to 6 pm.  Sphelele Cele, spokesperson for Ugu said areas affected by the shutdown were two parts of Southport, Sea Park and the entire Umtentweni area.  Cele said the old pipes and valves are believed to be the major contributing factor to the current predicament of intermittent supply in these communities since the commencement of the festive season. "We will be filling up the Melville Reservoir during the shutdown of the supply main to Umtentweni area. This will allow adequate build-up of water supply for this reservoir. This will allow the reinstatement of normal water supply to Melville, Pumula and Umzumbe areas by tomorrow(Wednesday). High-lying areas of these communities should be fully restored," Cele said.  Port Shepstone resident, Sharon Pitzer vented her frustration on Facebook stating that the area of Umzumbe did not have a water supply for two weeks.  Daily News
