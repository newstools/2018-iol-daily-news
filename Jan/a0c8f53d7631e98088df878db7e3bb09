Henry Bolton, 54, confirmed he had started a relationship recently with Jo Marney, a party member from Kent. Marney, who describes herself as a model, actor and journalist, has posted Facebook pictures of her and Bolton together over Christmas. In a message to Ukip members last night, Bolton admitted the relationship, but denied they had carried out a "clandestine affair". He wrote: "If you follow me on social media you will have already seen that recently I have spent time with somebody who has become increasingly important to me."  Bolton has three children - one aged 32 from his Danish first wife, and two aged four and one from second wife Titiana Smurova-Bolton, who is from Kimovsk, near Moscow.  Daily Mail
