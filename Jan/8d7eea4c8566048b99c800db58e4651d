Durban â€“ More than 400 teenagers will descend onto Durban's Addington Beach this weekend, in the hopes of securing top spots in the Spar Sola KZN Nipper Surf Lifesaving Champs. The event, hosted by Marine SLC, will feature the entire programme of events on the beach and in the surf, fuelling the healthy rivalry between the strong Durban clubs Pirates, Durban Surf, Marine and uMhlanga Rocks and the concerted challenge from the north and south coast clubs. A large and talented team of Nippers from Umhlanga Rocks SLC has been training hard for the event and could end the reign of the Durban Surf team. The weekend's programme of swim, board, body board, run-swim-run, Iron Nipper, flags, sprint beach relay, board relay, bodyboard relay, and taplin events will feature over 400 boys and girls ranging from 8 to 14 years of age. Durban Surf has managed to win the overall title for the last few years and will start as favourites to retain their title. There is no charge for spectators. Competition starts at 1pm on Saturday afternoon and 7:30am on Sunday morning. The Spar Sola KZN Nipper Champs take place from 1pm on Saturday 26 January and from 7:30am on Sunday 27 January.
