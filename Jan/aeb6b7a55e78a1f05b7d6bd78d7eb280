Durban - Bathers, fishermen, coastal hikers and beach strollers are urged to be cautious as the full moon Spring Tide is set to affect the coastline this week. Craig Lambinon, spokesperson for the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) explained that the beginning phase of the Full Moon (Blue Moon) Spring Tide has begun to increase in intensity as it builds towards the Spring Tide Peak on Wednesday, January 31. “The full moon Spring Tide will last until after the first weekend of February. Bathers should only go to beaches where and when lifeguards are on duty and swim within the safe demarcated swimming zones that lifeguards post using their red and yellow flags,” he said. Lambinon said Spring Tides happen twice every month at Full moon and at New Moon affecting every coastline and bring a higher than normal high tide and a lower than normal low tide. He said there were no such things has freak or rogue waves. “Waves are always unpredictable in height, size and frequency and this is normal for waves anywhere along any coastline hence caution is always advised around the coast. Last week, a 7-year-old girl drowned after a large wave knocked her off a Durban pier. A bakkie was also damaged after a large wave crashed into it at a beach in Ballito, north of Durban. The owner was believed to have been trying to launch his boat at the time. Daily News
