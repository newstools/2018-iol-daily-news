Durban - A 34-year-old man was electrocuted after tramping on live electrical wires on the N2 near Chesterville on Thursday morning. The man was allegedly a part of a group of protesters taking part in demonstrations along the N2 from the night before.  It is believed that irate residents from the nearby informal settlement took to the busy highway armed with rocks and other items and blocked the road on Wednesday night. The protest comes after shacks illegally built along the freeway near Chesterville were demolished on Wednesday afternoon.  Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, Metro Police spokesperson, said the matter was handed over to police for further investigation.  In a separate incident, police are investigating a possible link between a charred body found in the KZN Midlands and disappearance of Durban North woman, Siam Lee.  It is believed that a driver was passing through the area when they stumbled across the burnt remains of a woman.  Haden Searles, Durban North and uMhlanga Community Policing Forum chairperson, said there is no link between the two cases at this stage.  "The investigating team is following up on every lead and every theory that is out there," Searles said.  Daily News
