Durban - The South African Weather Service (SAWS) and the eThekwini Municipality have issued a weather warning as wind gusts move through the coast of KwaZulu-Natal ahead of an approaching cold front. Aslam Sardiwalla, SAWS weather forecaster, said the wind gusts have already been experienced as far as King Shaka International Airport and are expected to move further up the coast to Richards Bay. Sardiwalla said winds speeds are between 35 - 40 knots per hour. “This weather system will be accompanied by clouds and showers in the afternoon,” said Sardiwalla. “Severe thunderstorms can also be experienced in the western parts of the province.” Sardiwalla said informal settlements are likely to be affected. The municipality has reminded residents at informal settlements to apply fire safety precautions as accidental fires can spread rapidly and affect many households. They also warned residents of sudden cross winds if they are travelling, especially between buildings, fallen trees, power lines and flying degrees. “Small boats must stay away from the open sea and seek the shelter of a harbour, river estuary or protected bay. Parked aircraft should be pointed into the direction of the wind and secured. Stay tuned to the radio and TV for any further warnings,” said Mandla Nsele, eThekwini Municipality Deputy Head of Communications. Daily News
