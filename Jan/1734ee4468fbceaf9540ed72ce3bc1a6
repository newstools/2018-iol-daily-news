Durban - Two men were arrested after they were spotted carrying rocks, while walking along a pedestrian bridge over the N2 near Nandi Drive on Wednesday. It is believed that a motorist, passing the area, spotted the two men and contacted police. Metro police officers patrolling in the area, responded and made the arrests. Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, Metro Police spokesperson, confirmed that the men, aged 23 and 25, were handed over to Greenwood Park SAPS. “The two were arrested for possession of a dangerous weapon. An okapi knife was also recovered from the men,” Sewpersad said. Earlier in the day, a woman became the latest victim of the ongoing rock throwing attacks. She was driving on the N3 towards the Durban Central Business District when a man allegedly threw a rock onto her Mini Cooper. The driver, although shaken up, was not injured. Last week, two elderly women were driving in the same vicinity when a rock was thrown onto the bonnet of the Hyundai i10 they were travelling in. The rock hit the bonnet and rolled onto the windscreen. There have been a spate of similar attacks in various parts of the city. Last month, two people were killed when a rock crashed through their vehicle windscreen. Siblings; Amina and Abdur Raheem Haffejee, were rushed to hospital but had succumbed to their injuries.
