Durban - A driver and his passenger escaped serious injury after a rock was thrown into the vehicle that they were travelling in on Sunday night. The pair were travelling along Chris Hani (North Coast) Road, near the bridge before in the N2. They were driving towards Phoenix. Kyle van Reenen of Crisis Care Medical, said the incident happened just after 7pm. “Luckily the driver and single occupant of the vehicle, did not sustain any serious injury. He was assessed and treated by Crisis Medical paramedics and refused further hospital care,” van Reenen said. Police are investigating further. As a result of rock throwing incidents along highways, the municipality has proposed that safety barriers and closed-circuit cameras be installed over bridges in hotspot areas. Deputy Mayor Fawzia Peer said  task team has been formed by the municipality to oversee the implementation of all proposed interventions. “This includes ensuring increased police visibility after conducting a risk assessment to identify hotspots,” Peer said.
