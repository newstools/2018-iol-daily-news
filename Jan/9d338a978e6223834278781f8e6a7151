The workshop aimed to provide a forum for identifying ways to increase women’s roles in parliaments, legislatures and other decision-making bodies in Africa. In her opening speech, Lindiwe Maseko, CPA chairperson, said despite strides made in the representation of women, concerns remained about slow progress in bridging gaps that existed in the participation of women in key decision-making areas. “Women’s representation is not only about numbers and quotas, as democracy could not be fully realised without the empowerment of women,” Maseko said. She said efforts to target all stages of women’s political participation had to be intensified, as the mere presence of women in positions of influence would not translate to women’s concerns being addressed or lead to a better quality of life for them, she said. Participants from various African countries shared information on women’s situations and strategies to eradicate existing harmful practices. Daily News
