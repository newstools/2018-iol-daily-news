The letter labelled the reaction to sexual harassment claims that have hit Hollywood heavyweights such as Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey as a “witch-hunt”. It garnered a backlash globally and locally. Commission on Gender Equality spokesperson Javu Baloyi described the letter as distasteful and against equality.  “It is women like her (Deneuve) who help to maintain the patriarchy of men,” he said. He said campaigns such as #MeToo, NoExcuses and #NotInMyName were empowering women in a patriarchal society.  “What the letter only serves to do is give men ammunition to say that there are women who share similar views as them. It does a lot of damage to the fight for women’s rights,” Baloyi said.   Chairperson of the Diakonia Council of Churches Reverend Ian Booth said he was fully behind the #MeToo campaign.  “Women in all levels of society are victims of bad treatment by men,” Booth said. “Comments like these diminish the seriousness of the problem.” Trish Buchanan, of the Jess Foord Foundation, said she was not happy about Deneuve’s comments.  “We know how hard it is for women to speak out,” she said.  Buchanan said victims of sexual abuse could take years to speak out. The trauma sometimes meant victims were not able to move on with their lives. Actor Aaron Mcilroy said any form of cruelty and exploitation was wrong.  He said this was representative of a wider problem around the world. The Golden Globe Awards earlier this week was characterised by celebrities wearing black to protest against sexual harassment in the industry.  Deneuve was part of 100 signatories to the open letter in the French Newspaper, Le Monde.   She also defended the right of men to hit on women and said stealing a kiss was not a crime.   Daily News
