Durban - Management and the executive council at the Durban University of Technology is calling on unions to meet and engage in more meaningful negotiations. This appeal was made at the press briefing at DUT on Thursday, eight days after disgruntled staff went on strike following an impasse in wage negotiations. Addressing the issue of the ongoing staff strike, Wiseman Madinane, DUT Council Chairperson said despite their attempts to sit down with unions, they have not had much success. Almost two weeks ago, members of the National  Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu), Tertiary Education National Union of South Africa (Tenusa) and National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) obtained a strike certificate and embarked on protest action.

Mthembu said they had began the negotiation process in 2017. “In January those negotiations continued. Council was told that the negotiations did not yield any results. Management tried to intervene and when we went to meet with them, we were informed of their intent to strike,” he said. According to Professor Thandwa Mthembu, they had revised their four percent offer, however unions are standing firm on their request for a 10 percent increase. DUT has stated that they are prepared to meet with unions in the presence of a professional mediator who will put together a mediation process. Daily News
