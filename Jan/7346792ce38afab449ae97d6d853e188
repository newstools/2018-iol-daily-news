Durban - Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi has said that KwaZulu-Natal is still third in the Listeriosis outbreak distribution list. 
KwaZulu-Natal accounts for 7% of Listeriosis cases, the Western Cape 13% and Gauteng has 61% of cases. 
Over a month ago, South Africans learned about Listeriosis, a disease caused by eating food contaminated with the Listeria monocytogenes bacterium, which is found in soil, water and vegetation. Animal foods and fresh produce can be contaminated. 
Motsoaledi said there were 727 laboratory-confirmed cases that occurred in the country since January 2017. However, since December 5, 2017 there had been 170 more cases that emerged. 
Of the 727 laboratory-confirmed cases, only 134 patients were traced, and 61 of these have died. 
Motsoaledi added that the department had amended the list of notable diseases to include Listeriosis since December 5. 
Those infected with Listeriosis can experience flu-like symptoms, diarrhoea, fever, body pains, vomiting and weakness. Other symptoms include septicaemia (infection of the blood stream) and meningoencephalitis (infection of the brain). 
People who are at a higher risk of getting Listeriosis are newborns, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with impaired immune systems such as HIV, diabetes, cancer, chronic liver or kidney disease patients. 
Listeriosis can be avoided by cooking food thoroughly, washing hands before and after meal preparation, and with the use of clean water.
