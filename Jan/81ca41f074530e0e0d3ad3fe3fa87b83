Deputy mayor Fawzia Peer said a directive had been given by the city manager to the eThekwini Transport Authority to erect the cages, to close off the bridges and prohibit people from throwing rocks on to cars passing underneath them.  “We will also be erecting surveillance cameras on the bridges,” Peer said.  In recent weeks, there has been a spike in rock-throwing incidents from bridges along the N2, north- and southbound. In a recent case, a driver was injured after a rock was thrown from a bridge along the northbound N2 between Tongaat and Ballito on Saturday.  Paul Herbst of IPSS Medical Rescue said the man was fortunate to escape with minor injuries. “The rock landed on the passenger side of the vehicle. The car overturned. The man was taken to hospital,” Herbst said.  Last month, in the same vicinity, siblings Amina and Abdur Raheem Haffejee were killed when a large boulder was thrown on to their car. The boulder landed on the passenger side of the car, crushing Amina, who was in the front seat, and Abdur Raheem, who was seated behind her. The driver, Amina’s husband, was not injured.  Residents have been urged to report rock-throwing incidents to the police.  Mohammed Issey, of KZN Crime Intel Network, said they had received sporadic reports in the last few weeks.  “We are urging motorists to be extra cautious and vigilant when approaching flyovers and bridges. Use evasive driving techniques where possible as a safety measure. Change lanes as you approach bridges. If you become a victim, call SAPS on 10111 immediately and advise them of your exact GPS location so that help can be sent,” he said.  Daily News
