The driver of the vehicle drove straight to the Alberlito Hospital, but the siblings were declared dead on arrival. They were buried on Thursday.  Their uncle, Ebrahim Haffejee, said they were extremely upset and saddened by the tragedy  “The family is coping and coming to terms with the loss. We are grateful to individuals and companies that have contributed towards the reward money. We hope the perpetrators are caught as soon as possible, hopefully saving lives,” he said.  Dean Macpherson, Durban resident and DA MP, started the call for a reward by offering R5000 and challenging others to also contribute, which has resulted in support from around the country.  “The last two days have been incredibly humbling and taught me much about South Africa. I have seen the response to this tragedy and the quest for justice to be inspiring. From an initial tweet and Facebook message that I posted it has reached 2 million people, been shared 1000 times and retweeted 4 500 times.  “It has raised R250 000 as a reward. I am convinced more than ever, that as a country, we can face any adversity because we are inherently better together despite those that seek to divide us along race and gender,” Macpherson said.  Captain Nqobile Gwala, provincial police spokesperson, said no arrests have been made but the  uMhlali police are investigating.
