Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said the man was arrested at Golela border post in KwaZulu-Natal on Wednesday evening after members had received information about a truck which was smuggling drugs from Mozambique through Swaziland and into South Africa. “An intelligence driven operation was immediately initiated and the said truck was intercepted at Golela border post,” said Mulaudzi. Mulaudzi said after the truck was searched, almost 200 kgs of heroin powder was found hidden in the back of the truck, with an estimated value that could run into the millions.
