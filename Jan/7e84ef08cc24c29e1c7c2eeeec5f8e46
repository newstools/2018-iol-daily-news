Durban - There is no cure for rabies once it has been contracted. This is according to Brigitte Ferguson, marketing officer and the Kloof and Highway SPCA. Ferguson was commenting on a recent case where a rabid dog attacked two women in Gillitts, west of Durban, this week. Ferguson said there has been an increase in the number of positive cases in Kwazulu-Natal. “It is for this reason that we urge all pet owners to ensure that their pets are vaccinated against rabies. It is a legal requirement to ensure that this is done. There is no cure once the rabies virus is contracted,” she said. On Thursday, a dog had to be euthanised after it began displaying symptoms of rabies. The dog was allegedly very aggressive and was trying to chew through the cage that it was in, to the point where the dog was damaging its teeth. Samples were taken from the animal, which tested positive for rabies. Tracey Lynch, a Gillitts resident and a member of the Gillitts Park Neighbourhood Watch, said two women had stopped to assist the dog when it was knocked on Wednesday evening. “The two women who were attacked by the dog have since been identified and are receiving treatment,” Lynch said. She said an appeal is being made for other residents who may have come in contact with the dog, to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Ferguson said residents are welcome to have their pets vaccinated at their offices at 29 Village Road, Kloof. The Kloof and Highway SPCA will hold its annual Rabies clinic in August 2018 however we encourage all pet owners to have their animals vaccinated as soon as possible.
