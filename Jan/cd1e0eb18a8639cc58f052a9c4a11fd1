This was in response to former president Kgalema Motlanthe’s report of the High Level Panel of Assessment of Key Legislation of Fundamental Change which recommended the disbandment of the trust. The report was commissioned by the Speakers’ Forum about two years ago. It calls for all the land under the trust’s administration to be handed over to the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform. This, according to the report, would enable equal distribution. The Repeal Act should provide for the repeal of the Ingonyama Trust Act of 1994 and for the disestablishment and dissolution of the Ingonyama Trust. According to the report, legislation on land appropriation was unique to KZN and the Ingonyama Trust Board has control over land in ways that far surpass anything the minister of Rural Development and Land Reform has in other provinces. “The deficiencies and ambiguities in this act and its amendments and the ramifications thereof have had a far-reaching effect on the communities and residents on the land concerned. The panel proposes the review of the Ingonyama Trust Act with a view to repeal or to amendment,” reads the 601-page report. Inkosi Phathisizwe Chiliza, chairperson of the KZN House of Traditional Leaders, said it would be the end of time if the trust was  disbanded. “There are people who keep on provoking the king (Goodwill Zwelithini) and the consequences for that will be dire. The Zulu nation is ready to die for this land,” he said. Chiliza said amakhosi would meet at Pietermaritzburg’s Golden Horse Casino on Wednesday and Thursday to discuss the report. Trust chairperson Judge Jerome Ngwenya  could not be reached for comment at the time of publication. Linda Page, rural development’s chief director of communications, asked for questions to be put in writing, but had not responded to them by late Sunday. King Zwelithini’s spokesperson, Prince Mbonisi Zulu, would not be drawn to comment. He referred the Daily News to Ngwenya. Daily News
