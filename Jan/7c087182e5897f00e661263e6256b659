The city’s business licensing manager, Qondi Liqwa, said on Wednesday this was a process conducted annually under Section 15(1) of the Businesses Regulations in terms of the Businesses Act 71 of 1991. “The Act requires that every licence holder must confirm every year that the business for which the licence was issued, is continuing to be conducted from the premises specified in the licence. It also confirms that no other business for which a licence is required in terms of the Businesses Act is being conducted from the same licensed premises,” said Liqwa. The Business Licensing Department said the businesses that needed to renew their licences before the set deadline included food establishments, health and entertainment facilities, as well as accommodation establishments. The department said it had currently issued 10260 business licences, with 90% of local businesses complying with the act. Liqwa said the department would conduct inspection raids to catch defaulters. “Those who will not have renewed by that time will see their licences lapse and the enforcement personnel of the Business Licensing department will prosecute them for trading without a licence. They will have to re-apply for licences and will have cost implications whereas renewing is free,” she said.  Liqwa said in previous raids it was found that about 2% of the businesses that were raided were non-compliant.  “They were then prosecuted and since then there have been numerous communications and consultations done with businesses to ensure that they renew their licences, and are familiar with the business licence application and renewal processes.” Liqwa said businesses were sent written letters and the city also communicated the message using various communications platforms that include the Municipal website, Metro Ezasegagasini newspaper, media and Sizakala Centres.
