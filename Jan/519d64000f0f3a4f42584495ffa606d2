It is alleged the men had taken the bike to the popular pawn shop and told an employee they had bought it for R2 000. Greg Alberts, owner at Cyclesphere, said he received a call from someone who saw the men walking into the shop with the bicycle. “The caller described the bike and I remembered that there was a report of an expensive bicycle being stolen in Morningside. I contacted the police and the bicycle was recovered,” Alberts said. Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Blood, Berea SAPS Acting Station Commander, was at the scene. He said the two men were handed over to police. It is alleged the bicycle was taken during a house robbery in Morningside earlier this month.  Meanwhile, a domestic worker was stabbed in the neck during a robbery in Musgrave on Monday. It is alleged two men, armed with knives, entered a house in the area. A police source said the men attacked the woman, who was alone in the house, and she fought back. “The men proceeded to stab the woman in her neck and fled with household items,” he said. The woman was rushed to hospital.  Earlier in the day, a 5-year-old girl was shocked by live wire at an informal settlement in Cato Manor, along Vusi Mzimela Road (Bellair). Garrith Jamieson, Rescue Care spokesperson, said the girl was rushed to a local hospital.  Daily News
