Durban - While schools are set to re-open next week for the start of the new school year, classes have already begun at some uMlazi high schools. The Education Department has praised the schools' efforts for upholding the culture of high performance. Kwazi Mthethwa, department spokesperson, said this culture, built on hard work, should apply to all those within the education system. “Starting off the year before the academic calender kicks off is not an obligation for educators, but shows dedication on their part,” he said. “They give up their weekends to teach as a passion and calling for their jobs.” Grade 12 pupils at Velabahleke High School in uMlaz’s G section began their 2018 syllabus last Wednesday. The school obtained a 98.92% pass rate and principal Bheki Mhlongo is aiming for every pupil to pass this year. “The focus since last week has been on accounting, maths and physical science. We want to give pupils ample time for revision,” he said. At Ogwini Comprehensive Technical Secondary in uMlazi’s P section, their focus has been on Grade 8 pupils, who began classes on Monday. This week has also been set aside for all other grades to collect textbooks. Vusumuzi Dlamini, the school’s principal, said they found that when pupils got to Grade 9 they had not completed and fully understood the syllabus. “We found this especially with maths. There are about 600 Grade 8 pupils who all sat for their classes from Monday,” he said. Dlamini said the Grade 11 pupils, who make up 10 classes, have also been at the school since Monday. Grade 12 pupils begin their classes next Monday. Daily News
