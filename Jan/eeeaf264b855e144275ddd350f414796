It’s called the ice bridge. Children in the late 1880s rode their sleds there, tourists strolled between the two countries, and entrepreneurs sold food and hot drinks from makeshift concession stands.  Mounds of ice piled up high enough to almost reach the top of the falls. Great was the geological wonder of the ice bridge and the three falls that form Niagara Falls in New York. American and Bridal Veil falls are next to each other on the US side. Horseshoe Falls, the biggest of the three, straddles both countries. Collectively, more than 3000 tons of water flows over the falls each second, making Niagara Falls a major source of hydroelectric power for the US and Canada. It is also truly spectacular. As Paul Gromosiak, a Niagara Falls historian, wrote: “It diminishes even those skyscrapers on the Canadian side.” But behind the white, pristine beauty was a tragedy that changed the history of Niagara Falls. About three-dozen people were on the ice bridge that broke at noon on February 4, 1912. A large block of ice fell on the bridge, causing it to crack and the floes to break apart. Many made it to either side of the bridge; three didn’t. Eldridge and Clara Stanton were paralysed with fear as they stood on a moving ice floe. Clara collapsed, while Eldridge screamed for help. They held each other, looking like a mere dot in a photo taken from a distance. Farther up to their left was Burrell Hecock, who would’ve made it to the Canadian side had he not stopped to help the Stantons after hearing the screams. Together, they were swept to their deaths. Their bodies were never found. Walking over the ice bridge is no longer allowed.  The Washington Post
