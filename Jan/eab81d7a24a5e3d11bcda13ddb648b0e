Durban - Police were maintaining a strong presence outside the ANC Kwazulu-Natal offices in Durban on Monday in anticipation of hundreds of disgruntled members who were expected to march to the offices. The disgruntled members are part of the Sezo Mchunu faction who are angry that Provincial Task Team  - after the Pietermaritzburg High Court nullified the provincial leadership - was apparently stacked with members of the faction that supports Sihle Zikalala. The list of 16 task team members raised eyebrows after ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule released it last week. The list consists of 11 people aligned to the suspended provincial executive committee and only five who are against provincial chairperson Zikalala’s leadership. On Monday, a part of  Stalwart Simelane Street in front of the ANC offices was cordoned off by Metro Police and SAPS. An ANC insider said the group supporting Mchunu attempted to disrupt a meeting of at the city hall on Sunday and had to be dispersed by police. "Police used pepper spray to stop the group from disrupting the briefing. This task team is only for three months as the province will hold its elective conference in April. This is not doing any good for the party given that there's work to be done in preparation for the coming elections," said the insider. He said the group claimed Magashule  had chosen people in his camp into the task team. At Sunday's meeting an unnamed NEC deployee who was supposed to address the branches, did not make it, but instead Zikalala coordinated the meeting. The insider said the disgruntled group converged in Pinetown before descending to the city hall to disrupt the meeting Daily News
