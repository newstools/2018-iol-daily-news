Durban - Three people pretending to hire the Arupa Temple hall in Chatsworth for a function turned out to be robbers who held up staff at gunpoint on Thursday. Ganas Govender, eThekwini ward councillor, said a woman wearing a punjabi entered the hall under the pretence of hiring it. Two men then followed her into the offices and held up two staff members. The staff are a husband and wife who also live on the property. "The robbers demanded cash and valuables. They tied them up and took valuables. The couple was unharmed but visibly shocked," Govender said. 
A security guard from a neighbouring school saw the men leave and when he went to investigate found the couple tied up. "It is sad to note a religious organisation that does so much for charity was held up. Criminal elements are getting out of hand. The courts should impose harsher sentences on robbers as a deterrent. I am grateful the couple were not harmed," Govender said. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a police spokesperson, said a case of armed robbery was opened at Chatsworth police. Daily News
