Durban - A 38-year-old man was arrested in connection with the murder of a KwaZulu-Natal chief and attempted murder of his daughter in December last year. Chief Linda Mathonsi (60) and his daughter were shot at by unknown suspects while they were driving in the Chappies area in Mandeni. Simphiwe Mhlongo, spokesperson for the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks), said the chief died at the scene. "Mathonsi's daughter was taken to hospital for medical attention. The suspects fled the scene in their getaway vehicle and a case of murder was opened at Sundumbili Police Station. The case docket was transferred to Hawks members for thorough investigation. On Friday 12 January 2018, members pounced on the suspect while he was at his place of residence. He was then placed under arrest and charged accordingly," Mhlongo said. The man appeared briefly at Eshowe Magistratesâ€™ Court and was remanded into police custody. He is set to make his second appearance next week. Daily News
