Gumede abandoned his bail application and was remanded at Westville Prison until his next appearance on March 8. The bodies were discovered in December by a local resident who stumbled upon them after he saw blood stains that led him on a path to the shallow grave where the 23-year-old mother and daughter were buried. Nelisiwe’s father Musa Ntuli was in court on Monday and said his daughter’s death had hurt him deeply.  “She was my oldest child and she had started working part-time jobs. As a person who is unemployed I was dependent on her,” Ntuli said. He went to court because he wanted to see the face of his daughter’s alleged killer, but missed the brief appearance. An upset Ntuli said his family were still outside court when the matter was dealt with.  He said the incident had left him traumatised. Daily News
