The huge machine on wheels is on uneven ground causing diesel to leak. Cables from the generator run into the Telkom premises on the same road and the spillage has been ongoing for more than a month, according to resident Jules Viljoen. The engineering company employee and resident said the diesel had been leaking and flowing into a nearby sewer line. He said the road was misused by heavy-duty trucks although it was meant for low-duty vehicles. “This road is not supposed to carry a heavy load, but trucks are driven through here. There’s a water pipe running underneath this road and the pipe has burst several times because the road is misused. It (the road) is meant to carry five tons and lower, and exceeding the load limit is the problem,” Viljoen said. He said another danger posed by the generator was that it was not placed on level ground, and that it could overturn during heavy winds. Paynee Chetty, Telkom’s senior specialist in media relations, said it would be difficult to comment on the matter because it was a public holiday. -  Daily News
