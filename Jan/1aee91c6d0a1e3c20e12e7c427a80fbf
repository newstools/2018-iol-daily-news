It has been a daily routine, for the past eight years, for Rajen Ramsami, 54, to park his employer’s Range Rover on the road outside his Asherville home. On Monday, while reversing the vehicle from the driveway, three hijackers ordered him out at gunpoint. They bundled him into the back seat. “I had a hijacker sitting on either side of me. The vehicle was being driven at a tremendous speed and the driver was always on the phone. They asked me if the car had a tracking device. I replied ‘no’. My phone was pulled from my pocket. “I was hit on my head with the butt of the gun because they thought I had lied about the tracker,” Ramsami said last night while waiting for treatment at Addington Hospital. He said he prayed and could see flashes of his daughter, Mikayla, 14, and wife Marla in front of him during the incident. His only concern was whether he would see them again. “In a side street, the driver took the corner too fast and (the vehicle) went into the roadside drain. The driver then pulled the steering in the opposite direction to try and steady the vehicle. When the vehicle flipped over thrice, I blacked out. I was awoken by the sound of a gunshot. I felt pain and was lying on the roof of the car,” Ramsami said. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the vehicle entered uMlazi B-section and overturned. She said the hijackers fled, leaving Ramsami inside. The vehicle landed on a tuckshop. Ramsami crawled out of the passenger window and sat on a nearby rock. The community helped him and he was taken to the uMlazi police station. “When the vehicle overturned, residents approached it. One of the hijackers fired a shot to disperse the crowd and pulled out his colleagues. They must have been injured. “If the vehicle had not crashed, I think they would have killed me,” said Ramsami. Chris Moonsamy, the owner of the Range Rover, said he prayed that Ramsami recovered from his injuries. The Sydenham SAPS is investigating a case of hijacking. Daily News
