Durban - A group of  about 100 protesters sang and danced outside the Durban High Court on Wednesday in anticipation of a court ruling on whether or not the eThekwini Municipality could demolish shacks in parts of the city. The court was expected to hand down a final order in the matter between eThekwini Municipality, the provincial Department of Human Settlements and shack dweller movement,  Abahlali Basemjondolo who sought the court's relief to prevent evictions. The shack dwellers’ movement was granted an interim interdict in July last year preventing the municipality from evicting  more than 240 people in seven informal settlements around the city in Durban without a court order. The city was also prevented from demolishing, destroying and burning people’s property. It had to allow reconstruction of homes that were demolished to take place.

The municipality however argued that those who were evicted were not covered by the order. The removals resulted in violent clashes between police officers and shack dwellers. Abahlali spokesperson Thapelo Mohapi said: "On the 27th of July last year we received an interdict that prevented the municipality from continuing with these evictions. "However the  eThekwini municipality thinks they are a law unto themselves they continued with evictions, illegally and violently demolishing people's structures." The city has over the past months fought - at time violent battles - with shack dwellers as it tried to demolish newly erected shacks in Bonella, Cator Manor and Mariannridge. Daily News
