This week, loose structures, crates, wood, rocks and posters were cleared from the Isipingo central business district. “Illegal dumping and littering continues to be a serious problem, despite the work of the Isipingo task team that began its operations in July 2017,” said Musa Mbhele, the team leader responsible for the clean-up operations in the area. He said crime and grime, dysfunctional infrastructure and social ills were some of the problems facing them. “Despite numerous clean-up operations and an intensive one after the floods in October, people continue to dump rubble, tyres and other material. “Illegal informal trading, damaged infrastructure, lack of compliance with health, town planning and building regulations, illegal connections to water and electricity are all day-to-day issues dealt with by officials,” Mbhele said. Their night-time operations give the city a chance to clean up in the absence of the congestion experienced during the day. “We are committed to renewing and regenerating our key economic and residential zones to ensure that they function smoothly and efficiently, free of crime and grime. The municipality calls on all community members, business and other stakeholders to take ownership of their areas and play a role towards achieving this vision by taking pride in their surroundings and ensuring compliance with city 
by-laws.” Daily News
