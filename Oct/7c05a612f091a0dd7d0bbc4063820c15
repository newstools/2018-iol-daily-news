Durban - Pupils from Nqabakazulu High School in KwaMashu received a donation of 25 brand new laptops which will help improve teaching and learning. The laptops were donated by Simiso Magagula, KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Head of Treasury, in early October. Earlier this year Nomusa Dube-Ncube, MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) and Magagula had visited the school where they assessed the state of teaching. Magagula is also HOD Champion for eThekwini for Operation Sukuma Sakhe (OSS), said the donation of laptops was in line with the pledge and commitment that he and MEC Dube-Ncube made during the Legislature School’s Functionality Programme at the secondary school. “These laptops will ensure that pupils are properly equipped to take part in the fourth industrial revolution,” Magagula said. Sikhumbuzo Ndaba, OSS Coordinator, said learners and teachers were thrilled to receive the donation. “As OSS, under the Office of the Mayor, we are committed to improving the lives of our children. We want to help improve education that would in turn gradually improve the lives of poor communities. As government we want to do everything possible to assist learners who come from poor families. And through war rooms we are able to do this,” Ndaba said. Daily News
