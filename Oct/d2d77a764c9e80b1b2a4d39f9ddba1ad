Durban - Dusi Canoe Marathon champion Sbonelo Khwela has confirmed that his uncle Sandile Khwela was shot and killed last night. Sandile was a well-known Mbaqanga musician. His death comes just five months after his two teenage nephews were gunned down during an attack by two armed men at the family’s home in Shongweni. Details surrounding his death were sketchy on Moday. The two boys Nkosingiphile Vilakazi, 15, who was a Grade 10 pupil at Margot Fonteyn High School, and Mxolisi Mzimela, 18, a Grade 11 pupil at Thokozamnganga High School had been together in their room when they were killed. At the time Sandile was the one who received a call from his mother, who was home alone with the boys, after the incident said he never imagined he would lose loved ones in such a way. Nkosiphile was shot while polishing his school shoes and Mxolisi was preparing something to eat. The family at the time said they went through the boy’s room and the suspects didn't take anything which led them to believe that it was not a robbery. And now for a second time the Khwela family found has found itself puzzled at yet another brutal killing of their relative. Speaking to the Daily News earlier today Sbonelo the  Non-Stop Dusi Canoe Marathon champion said the family was still in shock and had not decided who was going to speak to the media on their behalf. “We have been busy running around today and we have not had time to sit down as a family to discuss who will speak to the media, please may you contact me tomorrow after we have had time to talk about this”.
