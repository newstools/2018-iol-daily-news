The award was given out on Sunday and recognises the work done by mayors in their respective cities. Gumede was recognised for her Zandile Gumede Foundation, her work in the community, and various other programmes she is involved in, which go beyond her role as mayor of the province’s only metropolitan municipality. The award comes hot on the heels of the city receiving the award for the greenest city in the country last month, when it won the World Wildlife Fund’s 2018 One Planet City Challenge. Gumede said she was excited to receive the accolade, which she dedicated to the youth and other women leaders. “We are extremely happy to receive this award because it attests to the good work we are doing as a cosmopolitan city to meet the needs of those living in our city,” she said. This month the city also received an award from the Department of Public Works at the Kamoso Awards for its Expanded Public Works Programme. Daily News
