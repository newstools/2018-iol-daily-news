Durban -  Residents of Phoenix are concerned that their community sports field will now make way for a housing development in Whetstone. The sports field which is accessible from Whetfern Road is also bordered by Industrial Park Road and Phoenix Highway. Bulldozers have moved onto the sports field levelling out the land behind Ferndale Secondary School. Residents said they were not informed about the development and neither was any signs been put up. John Pillay, a community activist, said a campaign by residents called "Save our sportsfield and save Eastbury Top ground" begun with a placard demonstration along Eastbury on Saturday. "As a community, we need to come together and be prepared to challenge people in authority to prevent this from happening and to make a statement together," Pillay said. In addition, Pillay said, the grading is now posing a structural risk to the Ferndale school building. "We have been badly betrayed by parks and gardens housing municipality officials and certain heads of local sports.  The field is also a site for religious activities," Pillay said. The development falls on the border of eThekwini wards 52 and 54.  Councillor Samier Singh, of ward 52, said this created a problem. "We handed over a memorandum to the city managers office on Monday. Rezoning of land in Phoenix has taken place without consultation. We are waiting for more details on what sort of development is planned for these sports fields," Singh said. The departments within the eThekwini Municipality was looking into the communities concerns. Daily News
