Durban -Â  A quick-thinking employee of a tuck shop used a Doom insecticide spray to scare off robbers in Hazelmere on Thursday. Prem Balram, Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) spokesperson, said that two men forced open the doors to a shipping container which was being used as a tuck shop. "Reaction Officers were dispatched to the scene and upon arrival, it was established that the victim was asleep inside the container when the robbers broke in. The victim then grabbed a can of Doom and sprayed the two men on their eyes," Balram said. Both suspects fled the scene without taking anything. Balram said his team conducted an extensive search for the two men. However, no arrests were made. Tuckshop owners have become victims of several incidents because they often closed their stores late at night. Balram believes that the two men were known criminals and would be questioned about the incident. Daily News
