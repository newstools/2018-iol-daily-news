Durban - Eight people have been remanded into police custody in connection with damaging an eThekwini municipality vehicle in Cato Manor on Friday. The eight made a brief court appearance in the Durban Magistrates Court on Monday on charges of public violence. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said that on Friday at 10am the community of Cato Crest embarked on a protest and blockaded the Vusi Mzimela (Bellair)  Road with burning tyres, stones and rubble. "Police arrested eight suspects aged between 23 and 54," Gwala said. This agitated criminal elements within the housing and informal housing sector in Cato Crest. It is alleged that a group of men then stopped a bakkie, travelling on Vusi Mzimela Road, with a municipal logo on the doors and pulled the driver out. The driver fled unharmed to the Cato Manor police station nearby. In a video clip of the incident, the men can be seen striking the bakkie with spades and breaking the windscreens and lights of the bakkie. Police said they arrived promptly. Only the seat had been burnt. Gwala said they also stoned the Metro Police and SAPS vehicles. The windscreens were damaged. Wiggins Road was also littered with bricks, rocks and tree branches. Shack settlements in the area are expanding daily. In another video clip, people can be seen running through Cato Crest. Police then fire warning shots to disperse the crowd. A case of public violence was opened at Cato Manor police station. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
