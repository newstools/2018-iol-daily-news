Durban - Award-winning Durban architect Rod Choromanski will be laid to rest on Saturday. His brother Glen Choromanski said Rod passed away on Wednesday. His brother said he was physically fit, loved Marshall Arts, surfing and also creating music. Choromanski,  of  Choromanski Architects, also played in his own band called Manteca. He had turned 57 on September 25. The Greenwood Park resident will be best remembered for designing the uMkhumbane Cultural Museum in Cato Manor with Dean Ramlal. His funeral will be held at the uMkhumbane Museum on Saturday at 9am. His death came as a shock to close friends and colleagues who passed messages of condolences and wrote about the impact he had. Here are some of the Facebook messages: Pierre Barlow said, "Was an honour knowing someone like you with such a great heart." Teboho T-Bone Hlahane said, "Another soldier of the arts down. I share this because we often place so much significance on our celebrities and not enough on those who work behind the scenes as the support structure. Rod was a successful architect who supported the arts so much. Wish there were more people like him." Manteca Salsa and Afro-Cuban Band said, "Today we weep. We have lost a tireless soldier of the human spirit. Someone who lived with urgency and intensity. He shared his space utterly selflessly. As a band we are eternally grateful to him for igniting the flame of Manteca and giving us a space to start our journey. For opening our eyes to the broader vision of music, Art, fashion, dance, architecture and community. He connected us. We have all lost a friend." Steffie Betts said, "Our beautiful beloved friend, brother, musician, architect and all-round good guy, Rod Choromanski, has left us to perform in the big gig in the sky. Too young, too vibrant, too good for this world, too soon... your generosity, kindness and many gifts will live on." Daily News
