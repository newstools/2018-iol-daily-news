Durban -  Durban Metro police are warning trucking companies to have the valid permits and licenses for transporting abnormal loads. On Friday, a truck carrying three mine truck tyres, higher than the average height, slammed into Charles Windsor Road bridge on the  M7 Westbound before the Belville Bridge. Parboo Sewpersad, Durban Metro police spokesperson, said the truck did not have a permit. The truck was later removed said Sewpersad after causing damage to the underneath of the bridge. He said police have seen a trend in trucks loading goods that are wide or high without applying for a permit, police escort or a private company escort. The truck had been impounded and taken to the Rossburgh Test Station by the Road Traffic Inspectorate(RTI). "We will not hesitate to impound trucks and hand out hefty fines. We will be monitoring the situation closely," he said. Motorists who were caught in traffic behind the truck said the truck had forced its way forward but could not go any further when the third tyre became lodged under the bridge. In pictures sent to the Daily News chunks of the concrete from the bridge is missing. Sewpersad said this was as a result of other trucks as well without getting the height clearance. Daily News
