Durban - "There they are". These were the words uttered in hushed tones as two men - Menziwa Mdakana and Zakhele Dubazane - appeared in court in connection with the murder of petrol station owner Kidesh Ramjettan on Thursday. The third accused Ayanda Shezi has been separated from the two and will appear in a pre-trial in the Durban Regional Court on Monday. The three men are implicated in the murder of  Ramjettan, outside his Rossburgh business in August. After a brief appearance, Mdakana and Dubazana were remanded to Westville Correctional Services until 22 November for further investigation. Ramjettan was standing outside in the parking lot of his Glazer Motors petrol station in Clairwood when a gunman walked up to him and shot him in the head. He died at the scene. Outside court, friends and relatives of Ramjettan carried placards and wore T-shirts imploring the court not to give the men bail. The supporters wore T-shirts with the words, "No bail for hired killers". The placards had a picture of Ramjettan with the words, "Justice for Kidesh". At their previous appearance, the court heard that one of the men confessed to police and said that that they were paid out to carry a hit on Ramjettan's life. Daily News
