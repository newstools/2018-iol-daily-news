Durban - The South African Association for Marine Biological Research (Saambr) has finally released which items were most common at beaches along the KwaZulu-Natal coast during International Coastal Clean-up Day. International Clean-up Day took place on September 15. Among the items collected were fishing gear, plastic pieces, plastic bottles, cigarette butts, styrofoam pieces, metal bottle caps, diapers, sweet wrappers, straws and plastic bottle caps. The dirtiest place along the coast was between Cabana Beach Resort and uShaka Beach - plastic pieces, cigarette butts, styrofoam pieces, metal bottle caps and sweet wrappers. Most collected items on International Coastal Clean-Up Day. Supplied Areas that were covered were from the top of the KZN coast, Maputaland Marine Reserve, down to Dassie Rocks. From Maputaland Marine Reserve to St Lucia, fishing gear was collected. Then from Richards Bay down to Casuarina Beach, fishing gear, plastic bottles, cigarette butts, straws and plastic pieces were collected. UMbogintwini Beach to Dassie Rocks was littered with plastic pieces, cigarette butts, diapers, straws and plastic bottle caps. “Beach clean-ups help inform us about problematic litter items in various locations and can help inform future clean up projects and retailers as well as legislation and municipal by-laws, when the data is collected and presented to the correct decision-making bodies,” Saambr said in a Facebook post. Saambr also said they hope to see more data from clean-ups going forward, as more and more people get involved in caring for our oceans. Daily News
