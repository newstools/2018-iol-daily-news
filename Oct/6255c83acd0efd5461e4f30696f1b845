The proposal has been made by several organisations, including the Correctional Services Department and several prisoners’ rights organisations - and rejected. Parliamentarians across the spectrum felt, as many of those they represent would, that a grant would reward prisoners for their crimes. But as research by PhD candidate Casper Lotter shows: without some way to sustain themselves, ex-convicts will return to crime, which is in nobody’s best interests. On release, many try to find work, offering skills learnt in prison, but find that, “having a criminal record is like being dead alive - there’s nothing you can do with it attached to your name”. One can hardly blame a prospective employer for not considering a convicted murderer or robber a good prospect, but there has to be a way to get them back in gainful employment, or else the killer will kill again, and the robber will rob again. Prisoners’ rights advocate Golden Miles Bhudu may have part of the answer in his proposal to industrialise prisons, so convicts can earn a stipend while incarcerated and contribute to a fund from which those released can be paid a grant. Of course, the grant will be a stop-gap measure, lasting a few months. The real challenge that needs addressing is proper reintegration of convicts into society, an altogether more difficult problem.
