Durban - Non-profit organisation Cats of Durban are updating their re-homing database. Nikki Moore, the co-ordinator of Cats of Durban, said they receive a number of requests from the public for homes for cats and kittens, and people requesting a kitten or cat. Moore then refers these queries to other organisations and direct people to social media websites like Facebook or to search Google. "We also have the names and contact details of a couple of these organisations. However, it would be useful to have a more comprehensive list of these organisations, so that we can provide this list to people who are looking for kittens, or wish to get some help in re-homing," she said. Moore said she would like to add the contact details of people that have a kitten foster, homing, rescue, etc group or organisation. "You do not have to be a member of Cats of Durban, you do not have to be an organisation, even if you are just an individual, we can put you on the list," she added.
