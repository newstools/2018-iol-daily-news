Durban - An eThekwini councillor claims a man brandishing a knife had threatened her while she was speaking to residents in Clairwood, South of Durban. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a Kwa-Zulu Natal police spokesperson, said a 50-year-old woman alleged that on October 15 at 12:30, she was at Sirdar Road in Clairwood performing her duties when she was threatened by a man known to the community. Sharmaine Sewshanker, the DA Proportional Representative forward 32, said aÂ man threatened to stab her near the informal settlement. She was speaking to women from the informal settlement regarding a skills development project. "As a public rep and politician one often comes face to face with such situations. I initially thought the man would be arrested. When I came back to the area to continue the work I heard he was released on drunk and disorderly behaviour. I reported the matter to my superiors then only did police take action," Sewshanker said. She said she took threats seriously because a number of councillors were under attack in communities. "He actually said he was going to kill me. What if he did. Where the police going to say he was drunk give him a break?" she said. A case of intimidation was opened at Brighton Beach police station for investigation. Daily News
