Durban - The man charged with the abduction of 10-year-old Sydenham schoolboy, Miguel Louw appeared briefly in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Wednesday where the case against him was remanded until December. A clean-shaven Mohammed Vahed Ebrahim‚ 43, dressed in a smart pink shirt, a black tie and formal black pants appeared before a packed public gallery in courtroom 10. Shortly after proceedings began, Magistrate Mohamed Motala asked if Ebrahim had been charged with murder. The answer from the prosecutor was no. Ebrahim was reprimanded for not going to the Phoenix police station to sign thrice a week. Ebrahim told the Magistrate that the court did not give him a form (to go to the police station) on the previous appearance. The Magistrate remanded the case until December 5 for further investigation. His formal wear on Monday was in stark contrast to the beard and unkempt clothes he had worn at previous court hearings. He told the Daily News that he had bought the clothes specifically for the court hearing, claiming that police had taken his clothes away. Ebrahim, who was charged with Miguel's abduction three days after he went missing in July was granted bail of R2500. Miguel, who was last seen on July 17 in the presence on Ebrahim was found in a shallow grave in Phoenix not far from Ebrahim's home. Daily News
