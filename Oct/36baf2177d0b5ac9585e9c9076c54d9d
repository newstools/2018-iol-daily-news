Pupils, parents and even teachers experienced moments of fear which revolved around not being sufficiently prepared, not understanding all the work, going “blank” during the exam and fear of failure. She advised pupils not to look back at what they believed were their past failures. “Focus only on doing what it takes to achieve the best that you can in the next few weeks,” she said. Her other advice to pupils was: 1  Break your study schedule into bite-sized manageable pieces. Use a calendar to plan what you are going to focus on each day and tick off completed tasks. 2 Get enough rest, eat healthily, and get exercise. 3 Be mindful of the company you keep, even on social media. Hang around with positive-minded and hard-working people. 4 Work on past exam papers. Ask for help when you are unsure of something. Get to know the structures of exam papers and how the questions are asked. Daily News
