Durban - A man was robbed of a large sum of cash after he made a withdrawal from a bank in Malvern by the "knockers gang" on Thursday. Colonel Thembeka Mbele, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said that at 11.45am the victim was at an ATM in Malvern when two unknown men carrying firearms approached him. "They demanded an envelope with cash and fled the scene to an unknown direction. No shots were fired. Members of the public are being warned not to carry large amounts of cash. They must arrange with the banks and deposit their cash into their accounts," Mbele said. A case of robbery is investigated by Malvern SAPS. The "knockers gang" got the name after holding up people who are on their way to deposit cash or had withdrawn cash from banks or ATM. Police said there is more than one gang in operation who stake out banking facilities.
