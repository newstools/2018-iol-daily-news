Durban - Significant structure failure at the Margaret Mncadi Drop-In Centre - for Durban's homeless - should be a warning for the city to take action to save the facility. The facility, supposedly one of Safer Cities’ flagship models within the Qalakabusha programme, has no proper electrical connection. Doors are broken, some toilets do not work and the drains are not properly connected for suitable outflow. In a statement on Monday, the Democratic Alliance (DA) charged that the eThekwini Municipality had shown no interest in maintaining the facility. “One wonders why and how the City can tout the centre as their flagship project when the municipality appears to have very little interest in the well-being of those who are to make use of the centre. The Deputy Mayor (Fawzia Peer) loudly and proudly proclaimed to all at a recent meeting for concerned stakeholders that there is no money for the homeless in eThekwini. This is contrary to the December 5, 2017, council resolution approving R1.7 million to be set aside in the 2018/2019 budget for the Qalakabusha project,” Shaun Ryley, DA eThekwini councillor said. Ryley said if eThekwini wanted to become the most caring and liveable city by 2030, then the municipality ought to start with correcting the infrastructure failures at the Drop-In Centre. He said proper regulatory frameworks and workable policies that could be practically implemented to assist the homeless should be created. Deputy Mayor Peer said the relevant person to comment on the matter was Bongumusa Zondo, acting head of Safer Cities, who referred the Daily News to Mandla Nsele, acting head of eThekwini communications. Nsele could not be reached for comment. Daily News
