A Stellenbosch University study found that scheduling water heaters correctly, according to the amount of hot water used, saves more on water heating than a thermal blanket or lowering the set temperature of geysers. “The best way to save on your household electric water heating, is to start heating water two hours before and stopping before taking a shower or a bath,” said Thinus Booysen from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Stellenbosch University. Booysen conducted the study with colleagues Philip Nel (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering) and Brink van der Merwe (Department of Computer Science). The research looked at how to best save energy used for household water heating. Booysen said because of the inefficiency and costs of household water heating, which accounted for as much as 32% of household electricity consumption where electric water heaters are used, they decided to evaluate the impact of various energy-saving actions for these water heaters. These included lowering the thermostat temperature, reducing volume consumed, using a thermal blanket over the tank and the piping, and using optimised scheduled heating control. Booysen added that people often struggled to make sense of these savings approaches and to choose the right one for the right use. Daily News
