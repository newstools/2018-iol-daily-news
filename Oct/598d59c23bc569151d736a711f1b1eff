Durban - The search for a missing Amandawe mother and her two children are over. KwaZulu Natal police said the woman returned home on Tuesday. Thandeka Msomi and her daughter, Minenhle, 5, and son, Lindani, 2, were last seen walking along the Mpambinyoni river bridge towards Scottburgh on September 1 at about 8.30am and they never returned home. According to KZN police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, the mother has safely returned home on Tuesday, after going to Palm Ridge in Johannesburg, to visit a family member. "It is alleged that the cellphone she had was stolen at the bus rank in Durban and was therefore unable to notify anyone of her travel plans," said Gwala. "While getting off the taxi at Amandawe, her five-year-old child ran into oncoming traffic and was knocked down. She later succumbed to her injuries." Gwala said a case of culpableÂ homicide had been opened. Daily News
