Durban - The South African Jewish Board of Deputies is calling on the Jewish community to rally together following the horrific attack at the Tree of Life Or L’Simcha Congregation in Pittsburgh, USA, that claimed the lives of 11 people. Under the hashtag, #ShowUpForShabbat, the community is urged to show solidarity this coming Shabbat on Friday, November 2 and Saturday, November 3, 2018. “We call on the Jewish community to flock to synagogues throughout South Africa in support of this powerful initiative,” the board said. AJC CEO, David Harris, said the campaign is to stand united against hate and antisemitism and our determination not to allow such horrific attacks to prevent Jews from affirming their Jewish identity. “The community of conscience must stand as one, whether in the face of the hate-motivated attack against a black church in Charleston, which took nine lives, or a synagogue in Pittsburgh, which took 11 lives,” he said. Harris said the board has noted the deadly attacks carried out at the mosques in Verulam and Malmesbury earlier this year.
