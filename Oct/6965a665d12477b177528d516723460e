Durban - Angry Expanded Public Works Programme workers stormed the Durban City Hall offices today, demanding to talk to Krish Kumar the city’s treasurer. The incident resulted in Metro Police officers going to the scene as discussions between Kumar and the workers’ representatives happened. In an interview with the Daily News, Kumar said he was in a normal operations meeting when a group of people stormed the meeting. He said the group were unhappy that they were not paid last week on 25th. “They were feeling that treasury had unfairly held back payments,” he said. Kumar added that the city would not hold back payments and would pay people on time when services were provided. Kumar said the Auditor General had said the city had earlier this month applied incorrect payment rates and should resolve the matter. “When payments came through last week, unfortunately, the department submitted incorrect rates and those payments were rejected by the treasury.” He said from the meeting it was agreed that some of the staff would be paid on Monday while challenges for other staff would be resolved as soon as possible and was dealing with the matter with the city manager. Kumar said he understood why the EPWP had stormed the meeting given their concerns that they had not been paid. “I respect the fact that they felt vulnerable, the fact that they had not been paid,” he said Earlier this month, the Daily News had reported that EPWP staff had gone on a protest demanding that they are made permanent. This resulted in refuse not being collected for days with refuse being strewn across the city's streets during the protest. Daily News
