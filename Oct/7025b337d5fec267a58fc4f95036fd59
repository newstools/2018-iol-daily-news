Mandla Nsele, eThekwini spokesperson, said the venue itself, Durban’s International Convention Centre (ICC), won Africa’s leading meetings and conference centre award for the 17th time. Travel professionals from more than 200 countries voted for the award. The city also took Africa’s leading city destination 2018, Africa’s leading cruise port 2018, and Africa’s leading meetings and conference destination 2018. Nsele said eThekwini had again towered over Johannesburg and Cape Town. Mayor Zandile Gumede said: “It is quite clear that, like in all our entities, we also have visionary leadership at the ICC. Had it not been for their hard work, our city would not have been catapulted on to the world map when it comes to travel and tourism. We are not going to be complacent; we are going to work harder than before to ensure that our city and its facilities such as the ICC remain world choices.” Economic Development and Tourism MEC Sihle Zikalala said the province had cemented its position as the “darling” of excellent international mega-events. He said the awards recognised the work done by the province’s Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions (Mice) industry. “We have successfully hosted mega-events such as the World Economic Forum on Africa, the Telecom World Conference, the World Aids Conference and Africa’s Travel Indaba, to name just a few. The province plans to use such high-profile gatherings to attract the attention of potential investors and tourists, which is essential in growing the economy, thus reducing the current high levels of joblessness and poverty,” Zikalala said. He said current estimates were that in the next three years the total direct impact from Mice would be in the region of R1.1billion. “Tourism KZN is on an aggressive campaign to increase the number of international tourists,” he said.
