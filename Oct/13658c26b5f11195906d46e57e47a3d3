Durban - Umgeni Water gave itself a pat on the back on Thursday after it's annual results showed that the water board had amassed a surplus of R1.2 billion during the 2017/18 financial year Ziphozethu Mathenjwa, chairperson of the Umgeni board told the media that the board was now in a position to roll out projects and create jobs. “We did very well and we won’t be seeking a bailout. In this financial year 2018/19 we have set aside R1.5 billion for projects creating hundreds of jobs. R500 million will go directly to rural projects, an indication that we look after our customers and citizens. The strength of our balance sheet will allow us to go to market,” Mathenjwa said. The presentation was particularly significant and the focus is on the record profit/surplus that has been posted by Umgeni Water and how the money will be spent. This profit is posted at a time when other state-owned entities are grappling with major financial and governance challenges. Mathenjwa raised a concern about the invasion of 10 Umgeni Water projects by organisations that demanded a “slice” on the projects. These organisations are the military veterans, business forums and community-based groups. “The visits of our sites by these organisations were not very friendly. This will impact negatively on water services provision to communities and on the cost of completion of these projects and ultimately on the cost of water supplied to consumers. We have realised that these organisations lack knowledge of governance. They don’t understand compliance requirements so we took upon ourselves to educate them about procurement processes, our policy and legislation,” she said. She said the entity’s enterprise unit was assisting the organisations in an attempt to prevent possible future disruptions. Daily News
