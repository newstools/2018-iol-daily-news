Durban - The 33-year-old woman who was shot and killed along with her 70-year-old mother in Tongaat over the weekend has been described as kind and energetic. According to East Coast Radio, Nombuso Dube, was the regional treasurer for the National Union of Mineworkers. NUM's Mathapelo Khanye told ECR that they had been liaising with the family regarding funeral arrangements, and called for the death penalty following the tragedy. On Saturday night, IPSS Paul Herbst said their officers arrived on scene and found both women had sustained fatal gunshot wounds following a domestic dispute. "It is alleged that the daughters’ boyfriend had arrived at the house, when an argument ensued. It is further alleged that the boyfriend drew a firearm and shot his girlfriend as well as her mother, before fleeing the scene," said Herbst. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said while the suspect is known to the women, the motive for the killing was unknown. She said no arrests were made. Daily News
