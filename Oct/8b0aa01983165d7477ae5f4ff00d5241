Durban - Police said that eThekwini municipality councillor S’bu Maphumulo,32, had been seated in his car after coming out of a meeting in V-Section uMlazi, when he was shot dead on Thursday night. Colonel Thembeka Mbele, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said that at 21:45, Maphumulo was in his Golf 6 stationary on the road when another Golf 6 stopped next to his vehicle. "The suspects fired shots at him and he sustained gunshot wounds to the head. The suspects fled the scene in their getaway vehicle. The motive is still unknown. A case of murder was opened for investigation at uMlazi SAPS," Mbele said. Maphhumulo was the ANC Ward 88 councillor. Nomagugu Simelane Zulu, an ANC spokesperson in KZN, told the SABC that Maphumulo was on his way home from a meeting with other party members when they were ambushed. Zulu told the SABC that Maphumulo was threatened earlier in that day when a group of people marched towards the counsellors home and threatened to burn the house. Zulu said she was not sure if the two issues were connected. Daily News
