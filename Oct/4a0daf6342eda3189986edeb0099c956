Durban - Construction to upgrade and expand the M13 and Essex Terrace in Westville, north of Durban, will begin this month. The eThekwini Transport Authority (ETA) said traffic on the interchange has increased significantly due to new developments (residential, office and shopping) that have taken place and other future developments that will take place in this area. In order to support a more fluid and efficient traffic flow through this area, the bridge on the M13 over Lincoln Terrace will be extended on both east and westbound carriageways. The on and off ramps will also be upgraded, extended and realigned to accommodate current and expected increase in traffic. The ETA also said Devon Terrace, Lincoln Terrace, Latina Place, and Essex Terrace will also be realigned and form part of the construction contract. Construction is expected to take 20 months. Traffic accommodation plans will be in place in order to minimize the inconvenience to those using the roads in the area, and some deviations are expected. Thami Manyathi, Head of the ETA, said: “We ask that people who live, work and visit this area be mindful of the construction for their own safety and the safety of those working on the roads. We ask for people’s patience, and understanding as we strive to improve our road infrastructure.” The ETA advises that commuters and drivers using these routes start their journeys earlier, and to look at alternate routes. Notifications of deviations will be posted on the GO!Durban and eThekwini Municipality Twitter and Facebook accounts. A community engagement to explain and outline the construction plans will take place at the Truro Hall,  Meerut Road in Westville on Tuesday, 16 October at 7pm. All are welcome.
