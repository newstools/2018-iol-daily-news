Durban - Pupils at Duffs Road Primary school, north of Durban, benefited from a generous book donation thanks to Toys R Us South Africa on Monday. Libraries form an important part of every school kids education, so when your school doesn’t have one, it leaves a big gap said Nicole Jansen Van Vuuren, marketing manager Toys R Us & Babies R Us South Africa. With a focus on educational development and community outreach, the Toys R Us team filled the shelves of the new library. Gopichund Maharaj, the School principal, said the gesture has overwhelmed our learners, some of whom have never read or held a story-book before. “There is nothing better than seeing these kids’ faces light up at the sight of books and it gives us great joy to encourage reading among the youngsters in our country. We are overjoyed at the generosity to help our learners with the gift of reading,” he said. Daily News
