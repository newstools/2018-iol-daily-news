Durban - Clear skies. That’s the prediction for this weekend’s weather. So if you’ve been planning your outside event all week or perhaps are hoping for a day at the beach, then your wish has been granted - for sunshine all weekend long.      The South African Weather Services said areas in KwaZulu-Natal will be experiencing clear skies for most of tomorrow and Sunday. Temperatures are expected to reach into the 30s so it might be a good idea to wear a hat and sunscreen.      On Sunday, Durbanites and those in Margate will wake up to partly cloudy weather conditions that will clear up. It may also be partly cloudy later in the evening. Daily News
