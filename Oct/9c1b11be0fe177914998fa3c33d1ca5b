Durban - A total of 23 herds stolen cattle was recovered during a massive police operation aimed at eradicating stock theft in the uThukela Cluster. The multidisciplinary operation was made up of members from the Amangwe police precinct, Provincial Visible Policing, SAPS airwing, Ladysmith Tactical Response Team, Stock Theft Unit, K9 Unit and local stations within the cluster. KwaZulu-Natal police said pamphlets were also distributed to the community members, educating them about brand marks, the impact of stock theft and consequences of buying stolen livestock. "Twenty-three herds of cattle was recovered after the Airwing members spotted a herd of about 600 cattle grazing unattended on the mountains and they were driven down for Stock Theft Unit detectives with community members to identify stolen livestock. The remainder of the cattle belonged to the community members who informed police that they are taken in the mornings to the mountains to graze freely without supervision," police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala said. She said the operation was a success and similar operations will continue throughout the province to curb stock theft incidents, recoverÂ stolen livestock, arrest stock thieves and educate other community members about brand marks.
