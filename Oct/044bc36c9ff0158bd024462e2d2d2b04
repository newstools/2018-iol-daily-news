Durban - Durban’s renowned Gospel Icon Discovery Competition; eThekwini Parks; Recreation and Culture Unit Gospel music talent search programme, is back for the 6th time. Auditions will take place from October 20 to November 24, 2018 at various venues around the city. Since its inception in 2013, the Gospel Id as it is fondly known, has uncovered thousands of budding gospel artists from around eThekwini Municipality. Several previous winners went as far as recording their albums while 17 collaborated recently to record a live DVD and CD at a concert held at the Durban ICC. The Gospel Icon Discovery Competition is primarily aimed at unearthing promising artists in the City, and mentor them to launch their musical careers. This initiative aims to see gospel music changing lives and breaking an entrenched cycle of poverty in former disadvantaged communities. After gruelling auditions, artists that would tower above the rest in the first round will be given the opportunity to showcase their skills at the main event scheduled to take place at Ohlange Sports Ground, Inanda on 08 December 2018. The competition has three categories: the Kiddies ‘Odwinkidwinki’ category caters for children under 12 years; the second category includes soloists and duets from 13 years and older and the third category is for groups of all ages. In each category, the winner is awarded a cash prize. This year’s First prize winner will go away with R20 000 and a recording deal, second place is worth R15 000 with the third winner walking away with R10 000. The cherry on top is that both second and third place winners in each category get the opportunity to record a demo cd. Auditions registration starts from 8am to 10am and entry forms are available at the venue.
