Durban - The eThekwini Municipality's executive committee's decision to approve a proposal for a R1bn loan for capital expenditure has been slammed by opposition parties in the city as reckless. According to the city's treasurer, Krish Kumar, if the city did not borrow the money it would have to reduce its R7bn capital budget expenditure for 2018/19 financial year which could hamper service delivery. Opposition parties however argued that given the economic climate, the city should focus on improving its revenue collection than borrowing. The official opposition, the DA, who voted against the proposal led the charge against the borrowing. Nicole Graham, the DA's eThekwini caucus leader said the city's economy was not in a good state, growth was virtually stagnant and the rates base was only growing due to property valuations increasing - not due to increased investment. "The municipality's days cash on hand has slipped from 84 to 74 in just two months as collection becomes more and more difficult," the DA said in a statement on Wednesday. "Chief amongst the defaulters are government departments and parastatals, who owe eThekwini over R900 million rand. The DA's stance is clear- treat government as an ordinary consumer and cut their services off if they don't pay. It is completely illogical to be borrowing a billion rand when you cannot recover the R940 million that is owed to you. Lastly, spending in eThekwini doesn't cease when the economic climate worsens. Overseas trips, mayoral events, and lavish spending are the order of the day, despite national government circulars requesting frugal spending. Ratepayers and citizens should not be burdened by a city government that cannot tighten its belt," she said. The IFP's Mdu Nkosi who abstained from the vote cautioned the city from borrowing urging the city to spend and borrow with in its means. Daily News
