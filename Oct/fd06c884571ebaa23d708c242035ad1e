The IFP is a predominantly Zulu party. Ever since the days of YS Chinsamy, Buthelezi has had an amicable and harmonious relationship with Indian political opponents. But what relevance and significance does the IFP have in the context of the current Indian generation? What can it boast of having fought for and achieved for KZN Indians? Let us look at the recent by-elections in Shallcross. The election was won by ANC candidate Previn Vedan, whose family are pioneers in the area. The IFP fielded a little known candidate at great cost. The IFP recently opened an office in Chatsworth, but I doubt it will garner support from a community with strong historic links to the ANC and DA. Observers will remember that councillors Ahmed Shaik and Vinesh Sunker were removed and replaced. Both were ethical and hard-working members. There seems to be no conscience at play here. Nessa Bhabuprakash was roped in with limited experience and has done little for his region. Singh has been forgiven by his wife, party and electorate for the sex video scandal. But the star in the IFP line-up is Les Govender, who adds little to any occasion but his presence. It seems he has honorary IFP life membership. A great lassitude has suffused the party. While the IFP is on life support, it is doubtful whether Indian politicians will be able to resuscitate it. Instead, it should look for high-profile black candidates who can take the party forward and not be public representatives for the sake of self-aggrandisement. Daily News
