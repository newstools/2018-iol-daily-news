The 26-year-old was attacked by three men who tried to saw off his legs. The incident happened in the early hours of the morning during his training ride near the University of KwaZulu-Natal. He was dragged into the nearby bushes and it was reported that he tried offering them his cellphone and watch, but they pinned him down and used a chainsaw on his legs. Gwala spoke to the Daily News from Johannesburg yesterday, where he will participate in the Standard Bank Ironman 5150 triathlon. Gwala said he believed he could clinch first place in the 400m swim, 20km cycle and 5km run. “Looking at last year’s times, they looked like times I could beat. If I open a big gap in the cycle, because that’s my strength, I can do the run. “After I managed to do a 10km run last Sunday in 50 minutes, I showed myself that I have the strength to go into a triathlon. I had expected to finish the run in one hour,” he said. Initially, Gwala planned to participate in the Tsogo Sun Amashova Durban Classic Race this Sunday, but decided to enter the triathlon instead as it encompassed all areas he wanted to test his skills on. “I arrived in Johannesburg this morning (Thursday) and I have already done my morning run and I am still to do my afternoon cycle,” he said. He said he runs at least 30km to 35km a week and cycles 100km on a Saturday. Gwala’s last operation on his leg in May was to insert a metal rod. “Getting back on a bike was not easy and there was some degree of pain when I did in June after the operation. But I had to push myself so my muscles could get back into the game,” he said. Daily News
