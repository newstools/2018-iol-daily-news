Durban- A 70-year-old grandmother was brutally murdered in Phoenix in what is believed to be a violent robbery. The Daily News has been reliably informed that Rookmani Moodley, was found with a belt around her neck on Wednesday afternoon. The Daily News learned that the body was discovered by Moodley’s son, Mervin who had rushed back home after his niece was locked out after returning from school. Mervin had been called by his sister-in-law who told him that his niece who was staying with Moodley was standing outside and could not go inside. Mervin tried contacting his mother on several occasions on the cellphone but with no answers and he then rushed home. When Mervin arrived home, he saw that the kitchen door was left open. When he entered the house he discovered the two bedroom doors open. He then checked in the first room and saw that a safe was missing. The safe contained jewellery, cash and other items in it. He then proceeded to another room where he found a belt around the 70-year-old’s neck and then called the paramedics and the police. Neighbours and relatives on the scene expressed shock at the death and described Moodley as someone who was caring and active. Daily News
