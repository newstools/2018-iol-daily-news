Anthropogenic injuries are not evident but there is lots of shark activity on and around the carcass. Removal is currently underway by the Ethekwini Municipality, "Olbers said. The carcass came ashore under the uMhlanga pier said the uMhlanga Urban Improvement Precinct (UIP) on Monday afternoon. The UIP said it was badly decomposed and does smell. uMhlanga Urban Improvement Precinct (UIP). The whale carcass had moved just offshore towards the uMhlanga lighthouse. The UIP said they continue to monitor the situation, feeding back to the municipality and the KwaZulu-Natal shark's board.  Olbers said the whale was sighted off oThongathi early on Sunday morning and to prevent it from coming ashore, it was towed out to sea by National Sea Rescue Institute and the Specialised Rescue Unit (SRU) from Ballito. Olbers said the North-easter wind which began blowing on Sunday afternoon blew the carcass back towards the beaches and it came ashore on Monday morning. Quentin Power, of the volunteer group SRU,  said that after consultation with the stranding network, KZN Wildlife and KZN sharks board a decision was made to tow the carcass out to sea again. "Unfortunately with the northeasterly wind that picked up shortly after midday it was blown ashore. Due to the location towing it back out was now an almost impossible task. A decision was made to remove the whale a short while later at the high tide the whale carcass was taken back out to sea and ended up under the pier at uMhlanga."Power said. Daily News
