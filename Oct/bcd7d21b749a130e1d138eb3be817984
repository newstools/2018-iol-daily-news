Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo urged the public to go to the Gateway Clinic at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital, about 300m away. “Staff and equipment from uMlazi V-Section Clinic have been moved to the Gateway Clinic. “The closure of this clinic follows a visit by the Health Portfolio Committee from the national government in July, which strongly recommended that it be shut down,” said Dhlomo. He said the reason for the recommendation was because of the poor state of the 64-year-old building. The facility was small, which meant it was congested and patients with communicable diseases, such as TB, shared space with mothers and their newborn babies, Dhlomo said. He said consultation rooms were small and designed in such a way that the privacy of patients was potentially compromised. “This has been a difficult decision. However, we had no choice but to close the clinic when we considered the reasons to do so, put forward by the portfolio committee. It was difficult to resist listening to their findings. As part of the same government, we had to abide by their findings. “This is a house that was donated to the government. It used to be a good clinic when the community was still small, but not any more,” he said. Dr Imran Keeka, the DA provincial health spokesperson, said the move was long overdue. “This is not an isolated case and there are many more like it. It is without a doubt that these situations arise and people suffer or die because there is either no political leadership or no accountability or, worse still, a lack of both,” Keeka said. Daily News
