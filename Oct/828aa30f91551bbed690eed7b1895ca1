Durban - South African President Cyril Ramaphosa made 443 homeowners when he handed over their title deeds to them on Wednesday morning in Kokstad. "This event is significant because it forms part of the work we are doing together to restore the dignity of South Africa’s people," said President Ramaphosa in a speech. He said from the wars of dispossession to the 1913 Natives’ Land Act to the Group Areas Act and other apartheid legislation, black South Africans were denied the right to own property. "Millions of African, Coloured and Indian South Africans were forcibly removed from their land, stripped of their assets and consigned to a life of poverty. "Since 1994, we have been working to correct this historical injustice by providing houses to the poor, undertaking land restitution and providing basic services like water and electricity," added President Ramaphosa. He said government had embarked on a programme to accelerate land reform, which will provide land and support to black farmers, secure the property rights of all those who work and live on the land, and identify well-located areas for social housing in urban areas. "Part of that programme is to give people the opportunity to own their own homes. In a country where the majority of the population have few, if any, assets, home ownership is a form of radical economic transformation. It improves the prospects not only for those who are given title deeds, but also the generations who will follow. The president also opened the home affairs office in Kokstad. "The Department of Home Affairs accompanies us throughout our lives. It provides us with the means to travel, to marry, to vote, to have a bank account, to run a business and to live productive lives. Like all other government departments, it is therefore critical that Home Affairs operates efficiently, that it is free from corruption of any sort and that it places the needs of its clients first."
