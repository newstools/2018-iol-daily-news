Durban - Three men who allegedly sprayed a woman with an unknown substance before robbing her of cash, are due to appear in the Port Shepstone Magistrate's Court today. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said the woman had gone to deposit monies at a bank at the Oribi Plaza when she was approached by two men. "The men sprayed an unknown substance on the woman and robbed her of cash, a bank register and a R1 000 cheque," Gwala said. She said the men then ran towards their getaway vehicle which was parked nearby. "Local police were immediately alerted and started to search for the getaway vehicle. Other police units in the area were also mobilised and the vehicle was spotted and intercepted. Two suspects managed to flee the scene on foot but were later arrested by the police officers. The third suspect was arrested inside the vehicle. The stolen cash as well as bank register and cheque were recovered from the suspects," Gwala said. The men face charges of robbery. Daily News
