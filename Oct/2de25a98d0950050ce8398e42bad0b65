Durban -  Private Security guards are on standby in anticipation of a student protest at the Durban University of Technology ML Sultan campus on Monday. Two weeks ago students protested about not being given student meal allowances called SBux. On Monday several small gatherings took place disrupting lessons and cancelling midday exams. Durban University of Technology, on their Facebook page, have warned students who are planning on protesting to desist from acts of intimidation, violence, carrying weapons and vandalizing university property. Staff on the ML Sultan and Steve Biko campus said the libraries were open and operating as normal despite social media messages circulating that students were trapped inside. On a Facebook message, the DUT  Information Technology department said all tests have been cancelled for Monday. The IT department will evaluate its position for the remainder of the week but for now tests are expected to resume on Tuesday. A student told the Daily News that they had completed the business law exam when a group of students began gathering at the campus and trying to get the support of other students. In a statement last week, DUT revealed that they fully accepted the demands put forward by the Student Representative Council and further discussions would be required in order for a consensus to be reached. Senior Director of Corporate Affairs at DUT, Alan Khan, said both parties have agreed that SBux payment issues and the late registration requests, required further discussion in order for all parties to reach a consensus.
