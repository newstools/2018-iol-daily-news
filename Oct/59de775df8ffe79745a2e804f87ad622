The Grade 11 pupil from eManzimtoti is struggling with Job’s Syndrome. “It has always been a dream of mine to be a pilot, ever since I was 10 years old,” Megan said. She was going to start studying in 2016, but after a compulsory medical check-up, she learnt she had protein in her urine. “I had to put my dream on pause and it was heartbreaking,” she said. “It has always been my passion. I still want to become a pilot, even though it’s hard because of my health problems, but I want to do it because I fell in love with it.” She said she gets staphylococcus on her legs, which makes it hard for her to walk. It kills her skin and, if untreated, it gets to the heart and lungs. “I can still become a pilot, but it’s very complicated when you have an illness that affects so many of your body parts,” she said. Linda Holder, Megan’s mom, said eight months ago she liked all the air flight schools on Facebook and came across the Rudmans, and asked whether they could help Megan. Holder said they gave her all their details and invited her to pop in if they were ever in Joburg. “About a week ago, they phoned me and asked when Megan (was going) back to hospital. They said Eagle Air was coming to Durban and said they wanted to meet Megan. So we postponed her hospital treatment for this once-in-a- lifetime experience,” Holder said. Percy Rudman, managing director of Eagle Air, said every three months Eagle Air has a cross-country flyaway. After hearing Megan’s story, they made sure their flyaway of 30 pilots in 10 aircraft made it to Durban yesterday. “Our pilots took her for an introductory flight around uMhlanga and Durban,” Rudman said. He said that to be a pilot one had to be in good health and have a passion for aviation. “If you are not fit, you may not be classified to be able to fly. Moreover, each subject must be passed with 75% and above.” Daily News
