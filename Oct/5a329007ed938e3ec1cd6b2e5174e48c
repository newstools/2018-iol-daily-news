Durban - Travelling long distances to access computer services and search for more job opportunities, is now history to young people at Hambanathi Township in uThongathi, the City said. Their multipurpose centre now boasts 40 computers with internet facilities. The City said it formed part of their relentless campaign to be a smart city. Addressing members of the community, City Manager, Sipho Nzuza said computers and the internet are indispensable in our lifetime. “We have already launched two centres in the last two years. The City has a duty to ensure that we create an environment which compliments technology. We are in the grip of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and all our people especially the youth should have access to IT resources,” said Nzuza. Boasting 40 computers, the Centre is a multipurpose facility which will assist the community to among others, prepare CV's and search for employment opportunities. Nzuza appealed to the community to safeguard the facility because the city would not be in a position to replace computers in the event of theft or vandalism. “There is a very bad habit in our communities of destroying property whenever there are service delivery protests. This is wrong and it is the responsibility of the community to look after every development that has been brought to them by government. "To date, we have built a computer centre in Pinetown and in the Inner City (Old Fort Road). "We will soon be launching others in Isipingo, Magabheni, KwaXimba, KwaDabeka, Inanda, Amatikwe, Vulamehlo, Mayville, Cato Ridge, Clermont, Intshanga, Cornubia and Emaphephetheni. We need all these to be protected by members of the community,” said Nzuza. Daily News
