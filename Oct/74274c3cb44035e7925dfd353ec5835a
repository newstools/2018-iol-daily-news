Durban - Police detectives are still searching for a man who shot two people in Phoenix, north of Durban on Saturday. Colonel Thembeka Mbele, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said when police arrived two people were found lying on the ground with gunshot wounds near a Hyundai i10Â  along Foresthaven Drive, Phoenix. "The incident happened around midnight. Charges of attempted murder are being investigated by Phoenix SAPS. No arrests had been made," Mbele said. Glen Naidoo of KZN VIP Unit, a private security company based in Phoenix, said residents heard three gunshots and when they came out to investigate found a man with a gunshot wound to his lower back next to the car. A woman was beside him with a gunshot wound to the chest. Naidoo said the shooter is known to the victims and is also related to the woman that was shot. It is also unclear if the shooter drove pass and shot at the car or shot them at close range. Police remain tight-lipped over the incident.
