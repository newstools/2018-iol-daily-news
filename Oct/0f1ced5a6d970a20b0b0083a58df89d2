School principal Pompey Sukool said they have done a comprehensive vision screening and have identified learners with poor eyesight and provided them with free single vision glasses.

With parents' permission, they offer a free eye test, pair of frames and clear lenses for South African children aged 6 to 12 years to dramatically improve their lives. "Children often have difficulties reading notes on the chalkboard. They are not aware they have problems with their vision. They have helped give the pupils vision and the ability to see ahead. This will surely impact positively on their studies going forward."he said. eThekwini councillor, Gugu Zulu said the school is always embarking on programmes to benefit their pupils. The school caters for school children from impoverished backgrounds the majority of which live in the nearby informal housing settlements. Daily News
