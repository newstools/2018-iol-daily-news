The organisation advised cyclists to avoid cycling between 4am and 5am. According to the Road Traffic Management Corporation, 451 cyclists died in 2016. PPA chief executive Robert Vogel provided the following tips to cyclists:  * Check your bike: before you head out, check your tyre pressure and brakes to make sure everything's in order. This way there's less of a chance of technical malfunction that could jeopardise your safety. * Ride in groups if possible: more and more cases of muggings and bike-jacking are reported to the PPA daily. Try to slot in with a local WhatsApp group for your own safety. * Wear an ID bracelet: most of them have an emergency number to call should you need medical attention. It also makes it easier to contact your next of kin should you be out riding alone. * Do not use your cellphone: as with when you are driving your car, don't text or call while riding. Rather stop to take or make a call.  “Let’s share the road,” said Vogel. “Courtesy comes free and leaves both parties feeling better. Acknowledge each other on the road and thank courteous behaviour.” Daily News
