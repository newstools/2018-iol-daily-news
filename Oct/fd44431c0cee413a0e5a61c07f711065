Shallcross is home to the Bottlebrush informal settlement, whose thousands of residents have protested often for proper housing, land on which to build their own, as well as electricity and other issues. The informal residents and residents of largely Indian Shallcross, who co-exist uneasily, will together choose who will represent Ward 71 in council from a list of eight candidates. The candidates put forward by the three biggest parties are all Indian. Some Bottlebrush residents are unhappy with ANC candidate Previn Vedan, an activist and human rights lawyer. They say he is out of touch with their needs and will not be able to represent their aspirations. This makes for an interesting contrast with Reservoir Hills, where the DA has installed a black councillor who the largely Indian population feels does not represent them. In each case, the voters feel betrayed by the parties they have hitherto supported. We will see how voters reward them in future. As we edge closer to the 2019 general election, the sixth in the democratic era, it is distressing to see that race still plays such a significant role in the choices we make daily. Daily News
