The Phoenix suburb has seen a significant increase in the number of motor vehicles since it was developed between 1975 and 1987. Commenting on the lane expansion, eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Mandla Nsele said work on the Phoenix Highway, between the R102 and Industrial Park Drive, was scheduled to begin in mid-November. Several callers to the Daily News complained that the road had not been upgraded to handle the capacity of motor vehicles. Inter-leading roads linking to main exit routes were congested in peak periods. A resident said one of the roads near Fernham Drive, the Industrial Park Road between the M25 and Phoenix Highway, could not cater for the large volumes of traffic, including heavy-duty trucks, although it had space for an additional two lanes. Glen Naidoo, another resident, said traffic congestion in Phoenix was going to get worse as a result of overpopulating the suburb. Naidoo said this caused collisions, minibus taxis driving on pavements, vehicles travelling counter to the flow of traffic and road rage. “While I welcome housing projects, I am wondering how the environmental impact assessment was approved when it came to the traffic management plan. We just fill up the place with people but no arrangements have been made for traffic alleviation and management,” he said. Daily News
