And on Saturday night, some 1000 guests attending the 21st birthday celebrations of the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre had to agree. For 17-year-old soprano Nontobeko, now writing her matric exams in Ndwedwe, north of Durban, left them spellbound with her rendition of the classical Italian aria O-Mio Babbino Caro. Wearing a dramatic eight-metre wide white dress, with colourful lighting patterns dancing across it, her performance was one of the highlights of the milestone anniversary. “She is a talented teenage Maria Callas,” said her mentor, Evan Roberts of Makulu Event Producers, referring to the world-famous opera singer. “The audience reaction is always the same: they love her,” said Roberts, who produced the event for the ICC. He first met Nontobeko three years ago when he was asked to use her for a provincial awards event, attended by 1000 people. “It was some two hours before the event and the cleaners were still polishing the place and the sound engineers were getting ready. She opened her mouth and the entire workforce downed tools at this voice that came out like Maria Callas and starting clapping,” Roberts recalled. And at the awards event itself, all the guests gave the talented teenager a standing ovation. “I have used her immense vocal skills at many corporate events since. Her talent moves people and at every event, the audience response is overwhelming. When a talent like this comes along, it's a no-brainer there is a star in the making,” Roberts said. Now, he is determined to get her a bursary to study further, saying she deserves to go to the Opera School at the University of Cape Town. Lindiwe Rakharebe, the chief executive of the ICC, said yesterday that all the VIPs at her table were “mesmerised by Nontobeko’s angelic voice”. “I suggested to my guests that we get together and get her sponsorship. We have to prepare her for the global stage as I am sure that is where she is heading,” she said. Daily News
