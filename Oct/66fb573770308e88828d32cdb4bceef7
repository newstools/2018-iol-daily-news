Durban  - Kessie Nair, the man who called President Cyril Ramaphosa the K-word in a video posted on Facebook has been denied bail in the Verulam Magistrate's Court. Nair appeared in court on Wednesday before Magistrate Ncumisa Gcolotela who had harsh words for his social media rant that went viral. In denying his bail request, Gcolotela said Nair had not provided an alternative address as the one he had given was that of his brother who had distanced himself from Nair's remarks. "This is the kind if the crime that can cause outrage," she said of his K-word riddled Facebook rant. While she was making her decision, Nair seemed to be unfazed by the magistrate's remarks. Gcolotela continued and said any use of the K-word was bound to cause pain to South Africans. She said that Nair also seemed to not understand the seriousness of the charges that he was facing. His refusal to cooperate with the investigating officer was an insult to the court itself, she said. The matter was remanded to 24 October. At his previous court appearance, Nair said he suffered from a heart condition and could not be in prison as he is on an organ transplant list and needs to be readily available for the transplant when a heart becomes available for him.
