Durban - A Risso’s baby dolphin had to be euthanized because of its very young age and inability to survive without its mother near the uMhlathuzi Rover mouth. The KZN Marine Stranding Network were called to the area where the dolphin was found. According to a Facebook post, a fisherman had notified the network. “An initial health and age assessment was undertaken and it was found that the animal was a very small juvenile, Risso's dolphin, probably only a few days old. A number of Network members mobilised to attend to the animal,” the post said. It said Risso’s dolphins are the largest dolphins not called whales, but are closely related to Pilot whales with a large dorsal fin and teeth confined to the tip of the lower jaw. In South Africa, they occur around the coast frequenting depths of 350-600m. Only octopus and squid (cephalopods) have been found in the stomachs of stranded Risso’s dolphins in South Africa. They are listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN and there are currently no estimates of population size for southern Africa. “All dolphins are protected species and the KZN Stranding Network received permission from the National Department of Environmental Affairs to euthanize the animal. This animal was retained for research and will be used to improve South Africa’s knowledge of this species,” it said. Daily News
