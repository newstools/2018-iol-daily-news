Durban - The Verulam community, that has claimed to have lost dogs to a deadly black mamba, remains on tenterhooks. Snake catcher Jason Arnold said on Friday that he had spent about two and a half hours of the day before, walking around, sitting around, looking for the serpent that had made an appearance on Wednesday in a dead tree. “It looks like a very nice spot for a black mamba. There are lots of nice basking spots. While I was there I could picture him sitting there,” said Arnold. “The community is on high alert. They will call me when they spot it.” Arnold said the weather patterns of the past week, which has seen both summer and winter weather, had confused many snakes. We see them mating actively and then this active mating stops and it starts again.” The confusing weather had, however, resulted in him having more call outs for snakes other than the most feared mambas and cobras, he added.
