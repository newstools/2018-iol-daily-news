During the storm, Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) at the Port of Durban managed to secure two damaged shipping containers that had fallen into the water. One of containers was carrying bags of nurdles. Although several bags were retrieved within the port waters and a clean-up operation was implemented, the nurdles had already begun making their way along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline. DEA spokesperson Zolile Nqayi said the department had been part of the nurdle clean-up operation from October last year to January this year through the Working for the Coast project. “We now monitor the clean-up progress and provide guidance when required. Service Providers (Resolve Marine and Drizit Environmental) representing the ship owners have continued to conduct the clean-up operations,” Nqayi said. “Approximately 20 tons of nurdles have been collected. Approximately 40 tons were lost to sea,” he said. He added that the department was providing oversight and guidance to the clean-up operation along with the provincial environmental department and the SA Maritime Safety Authority. “All areas where nurdles were reported to have washed up were visited. A number of sites north of Durban up to Umlalazi lagoon have had periodic washing up of nurdles and have been cleaned regularly. Where nurdles are seen to have washed ashore, a clean-up crew is sent to address it. There has, however, been a marked decrease in the volume of nurdles washing up over time,” he said. Bronwyn Goble, of the Oceanographic Research Institute (ORI) based at uShaka Marine World, said the effects of the nurdle spill on marine life were not yet known. The main concern was that nurdles concentrated pollutants, resulting in toxic levels. “These small pieces of plastic are mistaken for food by marine animals and sea birds, thus entering the food chain,” she said.
