Durban - Three men have been arrested for the murder of Glazer Motors owner Kidesh Ramjettan. The suspects will appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Niresh Singh, the family spokesperson, said the family had been desperate to find out the truth behind his murder in August 2018. The Singh family offered a reward of R300 000 to anyone with information that would lead to an arrest and conviction. RamjettanÂ died at the scene. He lived with his family in Clare Estate. "The shooter did not take anything. The murder was committed execution style with a shot to the back of his head. The killer fired two more shots at his lifeless body before fleeing the scene on foot. The family is baffled as to who would want to kill Kidesh. "Kidesh was a well-respected businessman and a dedicated and loving family man to his wife Lonica and their two-year-old son, Kiaan," Singh said.
