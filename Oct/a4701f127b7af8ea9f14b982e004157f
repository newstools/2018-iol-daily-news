Durban - Motorists travelling to the Durban city centre should expect delays as hundreds of people march through the city centre on Monday. Shack dwellers movement, Abahlali baseMjondolo took to the streets of Durban today in protest over what they allege is repression by the members from the city. According to the movement, solidarity protests were being held Cape Town, Johannesburg and New York. "Since our movement was founded in 2005 we have faced waves of repression including assault, arrest, torture in police custody, organised campaigns of slander, the destruction of our homes, death threats, the murder of our members during protests and evictions, and the targeted assassination of our leaders. The price for land and dignity has been paid in blood,"Â  Abahlali said in a statement on Monday. Abahlali baseMjondolo said they hoped the march will bring attention to "violence against our movement and our leaders, and all other activists". The march started at Curries Fountain from where the protest will snake through the city centre where a memorandum of demands will be handed over at the Durban City Hall. Abahlali baseMjondolo said the march in Durban will be supported by organised street traders, including the Market Users Committee, as well as Ubunye Bamahostela, the Congolese Solidarity Campaign and comrades from the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (NUMSA) and the South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU). "We will demand an end to violence against our movement and all other struggling communities. We will demand the right to free and democratic organising outside of the ANC. We will demand that all the murders of our comrades be properly investigated. We will demand that all threats made by councillors, as well as the Mayor, be investigated. And, yes, we will demand that our leaders in hiding be protected". Daily News
