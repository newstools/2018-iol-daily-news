Durban - Just moments after fans celebrated the Boks’ 23-12 triumph over Australia, the euphoria levels were raised even higher and for some those levels were sprinkled with emotion, as the #StandTogetherSA video was aired on Supersport just after the match. The video, which is just over two minutes long, asks a few team members who they thought about as they sang the national anthem. It also gets players to describe what it’s like to play together as a team. For Captain Siya Kolisi, he said he thinks about his son and those are watching the match. “When we sing, we sing for them,” he said. Wing, Aphiwe Dyanti, said he thinks about himself as a child who grew up watching the Springboks play rugby. Eben Etzebeth, the squad’s number four lock, said he often thinks about those who stood in the team before him. For Pieter Steph du Toit, being able to play for his country was a way of paying homage to his grandfather, who was also a Springbok rugby player. Later in the video, Dyanti said the feeling experienced when they are on the field, cannot be put into words. A clip in the video then poses a question to the viewer, “What if we all sang our anthem, arm in arm?” The video has been shared more than 1000 times and seen by hundreds of thousands of people across the country. Describing this video is not giving it the due justice it deserves. Here you go...   Daily News
