The direct London flight and the opening of interchange are expected to boost the local economy by millions through tourism and ease of business. The landing of the British Airways flight took place amid much fanfare where the first passengers were greeted on the tarmac by eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede and the MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Sihle Zikalala. The new British Airways Dreamliner 787-7 took off from London at 6.45pm (8.45pm local time) and landed at King Shaka International at 5.08am. The first passengers included British journalists and officials from Tourism KZN. Zikalala said the KwaZulu-Natal government expected major economic and tourism spin-offs.  “This direct route comes at a time when we are working hard to grow the tourism impact on the province’s GDP to between R65 billion and R98 billion over the next two years. We believe this would guarantee the realisation of our target of creating 183 000 direct jobs over the same period,” he has said. A few kilometres down the highway, Transport Minister, Blade Nzimande was cutting the ribbon to the opening of the Mount Edgecombe interchange. Nzimande said the interchange was a fine example of infrastructure development that had multiple spin-offs. Skumbuzo Macozoma, the South African National Roads Agency chief executive, said: “Due to the expansion of the uMhlanga and La Lucia Ridge areas the existing interchange had been operating at capacity with vehicles backing up on the N2 and M41,” he said. An additional 40 000 vehicles were entering or leaving the N2 from the M41 daily, resulting in substantial queues. Two bridges are part of the interchange upgrade. One bridge is 948m long and is the longest incrementally launched bridge in South Africa. It joins the Mount Edgecombe side of the M41 with the new N2 south. The other bridge is 440m long and joins the uMhlanga side of the M41 with the N2 north. The 948m bridge has 23 piers and two abutments. Daily News
