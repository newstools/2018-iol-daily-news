Some of the grand stadiums built for the 2010 World Cup stand as testament to such fears. One of the usual arguments trotted out to justify such expenditure is that locals will benefit from the new or improved facilities once the event is over. And so Durban bid to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games, and lost. But, in the meanwhile, work had begun on some infrastructure, including upgrading the Rachel Finlayson pool to meet Commonwealth standards. Because of what appears to be sheer incompetence, locals still have no access to the pool three years later, although millions have been spent on the project. The initial contract was for between R3.7 million and R4.2m, depending on who you believe, and further money spent to rectify shoddy work has taken the cost to R6.2m. Ratepayers must now cough up another R2m to, hopefully, finally have the pool fixed. There is no indication of any attempt to recoup money from the errant contractors, while the city’s architects appear to be completely clueless. President Cyril Ramaphosa’s exhortation to government employees to prioritise public sector spending towards activities that impact positively on economic growth appears not to have reached the eThekwini Municipality’s ears.
