Durban - Durban Metro police management have issued a warning to the public not to bribe police officers after a truck owner was arrested in Jacobs for handing police cash to look the other way. Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, Durban Metro police spokesperson, said two fuel tanker truck drivers were allegedly transferring diesel from fuel-tanker to fuel-tanker at a cost of R40 000. Sewpersad alleged that they were expecting to fill up 4 500 litres at an estimated cost of about R70 000 but was interrupted by a patrolling Durban metro police vehicle in Manchester Street, Jacobs last week Wednesday. "The owner of the fuel tanker offered one of the policemen R9 200 in cash as a bribe not to prosecute them. Our dedicated police officer placed the owner under arrest, "Sewpersad said. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KwaZulu-Natal SAPS spokesperson, said police had observed a truck and trailer parked on the roadway obstructing the lanes. "They then noticed pipes coming out of one tanker into another and confronted the drivers. The drivers failed to provide a proper explanation on what they were doing with the pipes and offered the police officers a sum of money," Gwala said. Three suspects, in their mid 30's were arrested for theft, corruption and bribery and were detained at Brighton Beach police station. The suspects appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court but the outcome of their court appearance was not available. Sewpersad warned criminals not to bribe officers because they were breaking the law. He said any form of corruption by police officers should be reported immediately. "Often the image of the Metro police is tarnished but here is a shining example that we have dedicated and honest police officers, "Sewpersad said. Daily News
