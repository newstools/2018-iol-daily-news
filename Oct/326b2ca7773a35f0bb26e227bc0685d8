Durban - The Marine Animal Stranding Report for 2017 in KwaZulu-Natal, has revealed that a total of 79 stranded animals from 22 different species were reported along the beaches of KZN during 2017. The report was prepared by Dr Jennifer Olbers, Marine Ecologist at Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, Scientific Services. “Of the animals reported, included were 51 birds, nine turtles, seven whales, seven seals and five dolphins. There were no reports of stranded whale sharks. Upon discovery, 24 animals were found alive, 34 found alive but subsequently died and 21 were dead. In 2017, 14 animals were rescued and released after rehabilitation within the year (10 birds, one turtle and three seals),” Olbers said. She said the majority of the strandings were in Ballito, eManzimtoti and the lower south coast. “Some noteworthy strandings included; the highest number of African penguins in a single year (eight individuals), and since 1982 only 10 Southern Elephant seals have been recorded in KZN, with three of these occurring in 2017,” she said. She also said conflict of whale harvesting versus scientific value is highlighted, a report on the first public stranding training workshop is included, a rare sperm whale was sampled and first evidence to suggest that mammal strandings are correlated to the phases of the moon.
