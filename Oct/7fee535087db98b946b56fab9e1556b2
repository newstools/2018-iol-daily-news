Durban - A 33-year old Shallcross businessman was shot three times when he was hijacked of his new Golf GTI on Wednesday night. He died in hospital. Mahendra Lillkan, Shallcross Crime forum chairperson, said they were left devasted after hearing about the incident in Safron Road, Chiltern Hills. Lillkan said the man had returned home with his family. When he entered his driveway an unknown number of hijackers approached the car. Lillkan said his children and wife managed to get off the car and safely flee into the house. "We not sure what transpired but we believe he was followed home or they had been watching his movements. His car was brand new and did not have number plates on. They shot him and took the car. He died in hospital," Lillkan said. The deceased was a prominent drag racing enthusiast, tow truck operator, and had an exhaust repair company in Chatsworth. "We urge residents to be vigilant at all times. It is sad we have to live in these times. Keep your home and outside areas well lit. Do not resist because material things can be replaced," Lillkan advised. Daily News
