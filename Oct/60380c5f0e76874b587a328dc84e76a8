Durban -  The case against the remaining 27 accused in the so-called Cato Manor "death squad" has been adjourned in the Durban High Court - again. Judge Graham Lopes adjourned the criminal trial to October 4 so that the defence can finalise the civil applications that have been instituted. The legal team representing the men - all former members of the Cato Manor violent crimes unit - had hoped to argue on Monday reasons why the State should drop the 116 charges including murder, racketeering and attempted murder against them. The police initially arrested a group of 30 men but in the six years since their arrest, three have died of natural causes. Advocate Anton Katz on Monday blamed the State for the delays and argued that the only remedy was to strike the matter off the court roll - as his clients were being prejudiced by the delays  State advocate, Sello Mayila, however, rejected this and argued that the delays were the result of the defence. He said the State was ready for trial but were being hampered by the civil applications made the defence Former Hawks boss, Major-General  Johan Booysen who was recharged with racketeering after the charges against him were squashed was also in court. Outside court, security was tight with heavily armed officers standing guard at the entrance. The 27 accused who have appeared before court 18 times since 2012 are alleged to part of a criminal enterprise. Booysen, who accepted an early retirement offer from the SAPS in February, and his co-accused are accused of running a "Cato Manor death squad". They believe they were targetted because they were investigating several politically connected individuals. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
