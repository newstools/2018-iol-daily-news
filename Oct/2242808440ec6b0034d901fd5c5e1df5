Fathima Romina Ali, an immigration practitioner in Durban, and a colleague were in traffic on Dr Goonam (Prince Edward) Street, when a group of people surrounded the car. Ali said the driver’s door was suddenly opened and her colleague was assaulted. “I thought they were stabbing him. I did not realise they had taken his wallet and phone. Suddenly my door was opened and someone grabbed my work bag and handbag. I began screaming, I became frantic,” a traumatised Ali said. After the ordeal, they drove back to their office in Overport. Ali was still recovering from the shock when one of her friends contacted her. Police had gone through her phone contact list in an attempt to track her down. She was told to fetch her bag from the Albert Park metro police base. Durban metro police spokesperson Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad said Constable Percival Khoza, who was on patrol, had chased the robber. “During the pursuit, the suspect dropped the bag along Soldiers Way. The bag contained valuables including R1500 in cash, a cellphone and documents. Khoza brought the bag back to the metro police base,” Sewpersad said. “No words can describe the feeling of getting your stuff back. It was amazing,” said Ali. “It was a dream come true. I was anxious to meet Constable Khoza and thank him personally.” Daily News
