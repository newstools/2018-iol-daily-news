A local herdsman who was tending to cattle in the area saw a man and a woman walking down towards the river in the area but he did not suspect anything," said Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane.  "Later the man walked back alone from the river. The following day, children who were playing near the river spotted a human body floating in the river and contacted police." Zwane said initially an inquest docket was opened for investigation. "However following an investigation, it was found that she was strangled and her body was thrown in the river. The inquest docket was changed to murder. Following a rigorous investigation by detectives, the accused was arrested and linked to the killing of the victim. A cellphone and a bag belonging to the victim were found in his possession." Daily News
