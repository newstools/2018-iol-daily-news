Durban - The Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s purse has run dry, and sources claim that this has been the case since last year. A source told the Daily News on Tuesday that  Polokwane, KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape were the hardest hit by lack of financial resources. “This could be a problem in other provinces too, it’s just that I have no information on the rest of the nine provinces. Investigators remain in office the entire day, no follow-ups on cases. The hired vehicles they use had since been returned to the rental agency because the monthly rental was not affordable anymore. This is bad in that the operations of that office affects people’s lives,” said the caller. Detailed questions were sent to the Public Protector’s office directed to spokesperson Oupa Segalwe on Tuesday. No response was received by the time of publishing. On Wednesday, the office confirmed receipt of the questions and said they would be attended to, so read the Daily News for an updated version of the story. Mkhwebane is under the spotlight following the Democratic Alliance’s claims that her report into the Estina Dairy Farm scandal reportedly shielded certain politicians. None of the politicians implicated in the R342 million scandal, which allegedly benefited the Gupta family, were charged. The matter is currently underway at the North Gauteng High Court. Daily News
