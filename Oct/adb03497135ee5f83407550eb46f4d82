Durban - The trial of the man who seemingly confessed to killing his student girlfriend on Facebook has been delayed for a week after his lawyer withdrew his services. Thabani Mzolo, 23, was due to go on trial on Monday at the Durban High Court for the murder of Zolile Khumalo. However, when he arrived at court on Monday his lawyer, Charl Claassen told the court that he was withdrawing his services as he had not been paid. Mzolo indicated to the court that he would take up a legal aid attorney to represent him. The matter was adjourned until next Monday. Khumalo's family, friends and students packed the Durban High Court in anticipation that Mzobe would plead guilty as he had previously indicated through his lawyer. Khumalo, a first-year quantity-surveying student at the Mangosuthu University of Technology, was shot dead in May at her off-campus residence at the Durban CBD, allegedly, by her ex-lover, Mzolo, whom she had broken up with days prior. Mzolo allegedly shot Khumalo twice, State prosecutor Calvin Govender said at a previous court appearance. In August, Mzolo said he intended to plead guilty to the allegations. Daily News
