Durban - The South Durban Community Environmental Alliance will be meeting with the Petroleum Agency of South Africa to talk about issues around oil exploration off Durban and Richard’s Bay coasts. The meeting is scheduled to happen on Friday. In a statement, the organisation said they have been asking various departments to meet with them to talk to them about the matter. “The communities represented in this meeting will come a far away as Hluhluwe,Mtubatuba, Empangeni, Richards Bay, Mthunzini, Port Shepstone, Scottburgh, Port Edward, Durban...The communities are affected in various forms as many rely on the ocean for an income and use the ocean for spiritual significance and recreation. Many work in the hospitality industry which creates thousands of jobs due to tourism and enjoy our beautiful beaches,” the organisation said. The meeting is scheduled to take place at the Austerville civic centre this Friday. Oil exploration drilling off the coast of the province’s coastal cities has been a contentious issue with public meetings between SDCEA, community members and  Eni South Africa BV being characterised by high tension and anger. The meeting comes at the back of a draft environmental impact assessment report that gave the go-ahead for exploration off the coast be done. Environmental groups condemned the report and said the exploratory operations would have a negative impact of the Indian Ocean’s ecosystem. Daily News
