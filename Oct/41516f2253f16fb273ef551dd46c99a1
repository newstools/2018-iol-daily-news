Durban - A stokes basket stretcher was used to extract a sailor, who had taken ill while out at sea, from a ship anchored outside Durban Harbour on Thursday. Lorenzo Taverna-Turisan, National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Durban deputy station commander, said they received a call from Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) requesting for medical assistance for a crewman suffering a medical emergency on a ship at anchorage off-shore of the Port of Durban. The sea rescue craft Eikos Rescuer II was launched accompanied by Netcare 911 rescue paramedics and Police search and rescue officers. "On arrival on the scene an NSRI rescue swimmer, the paramedics and the police boarded the ship. The patient was stabilised and a high angle extrication device rigged and the patient, secured into a Stokes basket stretcher, was hoisted onto our sea rescue craft," Turisan said. In the care of paramedics, the crewman was brought to our sea rescue base and he has been transported to a hospital by Netcare 911 ambulance in a serious but stable condition. Turisan could not divulge the nature of the crewman's injuries. Daily News
