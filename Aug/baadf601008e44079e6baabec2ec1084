The two are alleged to have got into an altercation with Bernice Rich - the ex-fiancée of UK convicted murderer and alleged Pinetown molester Glen Galley - when the private investigators had gone to arrest Galley for theft. According to the charge sheet, the incident took place in February last year. The two are charged with assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm. It says that they intentionally assaulted Galley and Rich by punching them, causing them certain injuries and bruises. The matter, which had been set down for the trial to start, was adjourned until September for a plea and for the trial to begin. Nathanson and Brits appeared briefly in court before the matter was adjourned. The duo’s defence attorney told the court that the investigating officer in the matter had been released by the state to be a witness for the defence. Outside court, Rich told the Daily News she was “unhappy” about the postponement. Rich was accompanied by Galley, who she said is now her friend. Galley is expected to appear in the Pinetown Sexual Offences Court tomorrow where he stands accused of molesting a girl, who was six years old at the time, at a sports club in the Highway area. Galley returned to South Africa from the UK after spending 13 years in jail there for the 2001 murder of a 69-year-old woman. Daily News
