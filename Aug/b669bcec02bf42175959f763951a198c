Durban - The Department of Environmental Affairs' Expanded Public Works Programme Working on Fire in KwaZulu-Natal attended to 20 fires over the past week. Nompilo Zondi, Working on Fire provincial communications officer, said these were veld and forest fires between August 6 and 12, attended by 217 firefighters. “KZN was affected by the High Danger Index, resulting in 20 fires across the province. Firefighting teams are fully trained and ready to attend fires in their various communities,” said Zondi. She said affected areas were Giants Castle, Mbazwana, Bergville, Ulundi, Umgeni, Hluhluwe, Buffelsdraai, Kokstad, Vryheid, Ulundi, Normandien and Underberg. The fire department was also called out in New Germany when one of the velds in the area was well alight. When one of the firefighters were asked whether they would put the fire out, the firefighter said they will manage the situation in case the fire spreads to neighbouring houses. They also said there is a fire break in the veld. “We urge communities and landowners to remain vigilant and not to start any unnecessary fires. We also urge people to have a watch on the daily Fire Danger Index (FDI) warnings issued by the SA Weather Service,” she said. “A high FDI is expected over the next two day over the province, for run away fires in the province. The public is warned not to start any fires as it could be detrimental and to contact their local authorities in case of a fire,” she continued. KZN has a total of 732 fully trained and fit firefighters based at 32 bases across the province. They also have 45 vehicles - 10 fire trucks, 10 bakkies with bakkie sakkies, nine strike units, eight buses and five hat trucks. Daily News
