Durban - Isipingo transit camp residents blocked off Mfundi Mngadi Drive (M35)  with dirt bin bags filled with litter and tree branches demanding to be given proper housing on Tuesday. The transit camp runs parallel to the  M35 which is a busy throughfare for traffic entering and leaving Orient Hills, Lotus Park, Isipingo Hills, Malukazi and parts of the uMlazi suburb. The roadway was reopened after the Public Order Policing Unit arrived and dispersed some of the protestors. Sunil Brijmohan, Isipingo ward councillor, who visited the area, said the issue was about housing. Brijmoham said most the 450 residents were promised houses on numerous occasions. "I have had several meetings with the eThekwini housing officials. There are making empty promises and not providing any feedback. We asked officials to move them into houses in monthly batches. They want feedback so they can plan their lives," Brijmoha said. Two years ago close to three hundred residents were given homes in low-cost housing schemes in Durban. The transit camp is built on a floodplain along the Isipingo river. A resident who spoke under condition of anonymity told the Daily News that they were concerned for the rainy season of October where flash floods have destroyed their homes. The resident said they were told nine years ago that they would be housed but nothing has materialised. The area has been prone to previous service delivery protests. Daily News
