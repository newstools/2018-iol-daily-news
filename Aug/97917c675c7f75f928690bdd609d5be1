Durban -Three men, who opened a false hijacking case at a police station, are expected to appear in court on Monday. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said the driver of a VW Polo was travelling with two other passengers along Watson Highway in oThongati on Friday night. The driver told police that he had stopped to pick up a hitchhiker from the roadside. "The driver claimed that the hitchhiker pointed a weapon at the driver and instructed him to drive towards uMdloti. The driver claimed that enroute to uMdloti he crashed into another vehicle and into a barrier. The alleged hijacker fled the scene and according to the driver, nothing was taken. Police obtained sworn statements from all three occupants of the VW Polo who stated that they were hijacked," Zwane explained. Following an investigation by police detectives, it was established that all three men were lying and had opened a false case of hijacking. Police arrested the men and charged them for defeating the ends of justice. Zwane said this is an indication that police officers will not tolerate the misuse of police resources through the opening of false cases. The men, aged from 18 to 22 years old, were detained at oThongati police station. They are due to appear in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court facing charges of defeating the ends of justice. Daily News
