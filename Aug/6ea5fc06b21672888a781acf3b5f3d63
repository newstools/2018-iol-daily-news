Durban - Disgruntled minibus taxi owners have blocked off roads near the R.K.Khan Hospital bringing parts of Chatsworth to a standstill on Monday. Police are waiting for officials from the eThekwini Transport Authority to address the taxi owners. Durban Metro police spokesperson Parboo Sewpersad said several taxis have been removed, by police, from the roadway at the intersection of Higginson Highway (M1) and R.K.Khan Circle. A bus was also stopped on Higginson Highway and the passengers were off-loaded. "We are on site monitoring the situation. it is quite tense but not violent. The mini-bus taxi drivers and owners have grievances against certain operational procedures like route disputes and traffic fines," Sewpersad said. The traffic had to be diverted through other roads. A similar protest occurred in Chatsworth in May where police were forced to use rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse taxi drivers and owners who blockaded the road. More than 50 taxi drivers and 30 minibus taxis were impounded by police. Daily News
