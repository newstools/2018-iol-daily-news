Durban- Police are tight-lipped about their investigations into the murders where two men were killed and another wounded on Woodhurst drive in Chatsworth. Chatsworth residents are still in the dark in terms of what happened during last week Thursday's shooting with several allegations that it was a hit or that the deceased where about to commit a crime. On Friday, KwaZulu-Natal police said investigations were still at a sensitive stage and they could not divulge further details. Police said arrests were imminent, however. Police were called out to Woodhurst Drive where they found two men dead in a Toyota Hilux bakkie and another wounded nearby. Nothing appeared to be taken from the men leading many, including detectives probing the incident to believe the murders were a hit. It is alleged that the men were travelling in the bakkie into Chatsworth when the shooting occurred. The driver had lost control of the bakkie and it veered off the road, onto the pavement and bumped into a low wall which brought the vehicle to a halt outside a pharmacy. Lieutenant Colonel Zwane, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said police are investigating what transpired. He said when police arrived they found one person dead in his vehicle with a gunshot wound to the head. "The second body was found just outside the vehicle with a gunshot wound to the head. The third victim was found alive a few meters away from the vehicle with a gunshot wound to the head," Zwane explained. The wounded man was rushed to a hospital for treatment. Two counts of murder and attempted murder were opened at Chatsworth police station. Zwane said the motive for the attack was unknown. Police did not say if the men were found with any weapons and who the bakkie belonged to. Daily News
