Mxolisi Cekwayo, the employee’s spokesperson, said daily service of the nets had not been done as a result of the strike. “It will be dangerous to swim. The nets have to be checked daily. If not checked in four days, they no longer serve their purpose,” he said. On Monday, wage negotiations between the board and employees reached a deadlock which saw workers down tools. According to Cekwayo, it was agreed at a meeting with the CCMA that wage negotiations would resume tomorrow. Workers are asking for a 15% wage increment, across the board. Business development executive at the Sharks Board Harry Mbambo said he did not have a figure off-hand of the last offer made by the employer. “We have made so many. I can’t say at this point what the last figure was.” He also said that shark nets were serviced because a contingency plan was in place. Mbambo, however, did not want to be drawn into when these were serviced. The KZN Sharks Board said because of the strike it had reduced the number of protected beaches it was able to service with the limited resources available. There are currently 37 KZN beaches protected by nets and drumlines. The board said visitors were requested to check with the lifeguards before entering the water. A telephone call to the eThekwini Municipality’s parks and recreation central office revealed that Battery, Country Club and eThekwini beaches were closed to bathers. The municipality had not responded to questions at the time of publication. Daily News
