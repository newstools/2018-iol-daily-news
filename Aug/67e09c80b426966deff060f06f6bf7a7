Durban - The accused in the matter linked to the kidnapping of 10-year-old Miguel Louw has expressed unhappiness at the postponement of his case. The man stood shaking his head as the prosecutor Patrick Magoda asked the matter be postponed for seven days for further investigation. The accused then asked to speak during proceedings and when his defence attorney, K Ariyan approached he abruptly asked her "did you tell them what happened, are you going tell them what happened?" After the matter was briefly stood down for the state and the defence to agree on a postponement, the accused informed the court he was being assaulted while in custody. Magistrate's Ahmed Motala before granting the postponement pleaded with the man to tell authorities should he know the whereabouts of the little boy.

Motala also slammed the state for asking for the postponement reminding them the charges against the man was a schedule one offence and not the more serious  schedule five offence, adding the state has had ample time to investigate. "Six people came today...and they do the same thing. I came here you said you need to investigate...this is not right, it's not right," said the accused after the postponement. Louw's mother spat at the accused as he walked back down into the holding cells below demanding to know where her child was. Daily News
