This was according to her grandmother, Busisiwe Mpisane. Mpisane spoke yesterday at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, where a prayer service was held by the Oasis Church, led by musician Khaya Mthethwa. “She lives with me at home and we are hurt by not seeing her there every day, but by God’s grace she is alive,” Mpisane said. “She is going into theatre tomorrow (Monday), but she is improving each day.” Mpisane excused Sbahle’s parents for not being at the service because they were at the hospital. At the service, Mthethwa said he had visited Sbahle. “When I saw her lying in the hospital bed, I thought: ‘She’s been crushed, but not destroyed, she’s been hurt but she’s alive’.” Sbahle was injured when her car “crashed and burst into flames” recently on Margaret Mncadi Avenue, opposite Wilson’s Wharf. Before the service, an hour-long workout took place where Sbahle’s friends sweated it out. After the workout, participants were asked to huddle together for a video call to the hospital where it was said Sbahle could see them. Fitness trainer and Sbahle’s friend, Yolanda Sokhela, said she structured the workout to be predominantly a “heat” one choreographed by both of them.Sokhela, however, refused to be drawn into speaking on Sbahle’s condition and said they had been given strict instructions not to do so. Another friend, Zinhle Mqadi, said Sbahle was in her thoughts throughout the workout. Daily News
