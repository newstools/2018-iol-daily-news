Durban - Online scammers are preying on people's love for animals and their penchant for pedigree pets. The last incident occurred this week when a Durban North man was taken for R98 000 after depositing money into what he believed was a pedigree pet breeder's account for a litter of French bulldogs. The unsuspecting victim only received one dog. When he tried calling for the rest, the dog breeder disappeared into thin air. According to KwaZulu-Natal police, at least six people have opened cases after being duped into pedigree pet online scams this year at the Durban North police station alone. Durban North police spokesman, Captain Raymond Deokaran told the Northglen News that a case of fraud was opened after the victim paid R98 000 for several pure breed French bulldogs. Pure breed French bulldogs are sold for between R25 000 and R30 000 each. Since the money was deposited, however, the victim only received one of the dogs and the suspect involved in the case has now disappeared. “The victim saw an online ad selling pure-breed French bulldogs. He contacted the person whose details were listed on the advert. The scam artist asked for the money to be paid upfront, which the victim did, only to receive just one dog. He has since tried to contact the number but there was no answer. In most of the cases we’ve opened this year, the scam artists takes the money without delivering,” Deokaran said. Deokaran said they were increasingly seeing more cases of people being defrauded online. “This is the sixth incident this year alone involving the sales of pedigree dogs. We are warning residents to be wary of scams like this. If it seems to too good to be true, in most cases it is. We urge residents not to deposit monies without checking the authenticity of the seller,” he said. He urged residents to adopt animals from reputable shelters and breeders. Daily News
