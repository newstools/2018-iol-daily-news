Durban - Police are looking into the alleged abduction of a 19-year-old girl who was found in the Inchanga area on Tuesday. Steven King, the KwaZulu-Natal coordinator of South African Community Crime Watch (SACCW) said the girl was reported missing to SACCW after she did not arrive home on Sunday. King said a joint operation was launched late on Monday evening by the Hillcrest Community Policing Forum (CPF) who made contact with the Hammarsdale CPF  and requested assistance from the Inchanga police station. Early on Tuesday morning, the combined effort by the CPF and police started to search an area that was identified by SACCW technical teams where a cell phone was being used related to the case. "After searching the area around Bhobhonona and following leads, the girl was found, taken to Inchanga station,  treated by medics at the station and handed back to her relieved family by midday.  It appears the girl was abducted and Inchanga detectives will hopefully make arrests soon," he said. King said he would like this to be a positive example of what we can be accomplished when people work together working as one team for one common goal. That goal, he said, was keeping families safe and cleaning up our suburbs of crime. "A massive thank you to all involved that helped make this a happy ending for the family involved. The ground search team included  Saps Inchanga members Sergeants Malinga and Ngidi and Inchanga CPF Member Majola and Hammarsdale CPF member Etienne Olivier," King said. Daily News
