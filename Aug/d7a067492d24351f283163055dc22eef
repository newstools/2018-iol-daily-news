Durban - A Twitter user who decided to have an Afrikaans language lesson on the social media platform had no idea what he was opening himself up to when the post went live. Little did he know that he would become the subject of memes, laughter and a little ridicule. This is how it went down: @TlotliTshey took to his Twitter account to start a conversation with other Tweeps on the topic of Afrikaans. It all started with “Let’s talk Afrikaans. I’ll start: Boerewors.”      His tweet had more than two and a half thousand comments, nearly 1 600 retweets and nearly 5 600 likes. Tweeps responses left other Tweeps in stitches. Others even add memes and gifs, which made it even more hilarious. Some Tweeps’ definition of ‘talk Afrikaans’ were names and surnames:           For others it was Afrikaans shows:           Popular catchphrases:           One word answers and the very random:                Then there were those who said anything and everything that came to mind. Some didn’t even join the fun and say something interesting. They just missed the point completely. It reminded some people of the hashtag that went viral (we forgot the hashtag) where South Africans, all races and cultures asked each other things they couldn’t understand that the other race or culture did. Those were fun times. Daily News
