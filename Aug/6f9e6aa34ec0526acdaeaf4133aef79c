Durban- A group of unruly protestors blocked off the busy N2 northbound freeway with burning tyres on Monday. Police are directing vehicles held up in the traffic backlog onto the M7 Solomon Mahlangu (Edwin Swales) Drive. Police are on the scene and have opened two lanes to traffic. The protestors set alight refuse and tyres under the Ridgeview Road bridge which brought traffic during peak hour to a halt. Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, Durban Metro police spokesperson, said police were on the scene diverting the traffic while they clear up debris on the roadway. He said when police arrived protestors had fled. "The reason for the protest was related to the demolishing of illegally built informal houses in Ridgeview by the eThekwini security management unit over the weekend. Police are on the scene,"Sewpersad said. The stretch of road has been prone to violent service delivery protests on a regular basis. The incident created chaos on the road with traffic backing up towards the N2 and M4 freeway near Lamontville and on the M7 towards Queensburgh pass the Bellville bridge. Daily News
