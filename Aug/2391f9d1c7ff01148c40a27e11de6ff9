Durban - South Africans are not shy to back down from a debate which was once again proven on Thursday when they waded into the Tweet storm created by US President Donald Trump who took to the social media platform to say the US would be looking into South Africa's land reform policy. Trump told his more than 53 million followers on Twitter on Thursday that he had ordered his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo to study the ANC's decision to seize privately owned farmland without compensation and look into what he calls the "large-scale" murder of farmers.       This is how  South Africans reacted to Trump's tweet:
