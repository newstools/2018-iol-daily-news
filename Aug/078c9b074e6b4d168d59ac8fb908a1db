“It is a special year too, as it is our 40th anniversary,” said Andrew Human, the chief executive. Durban is hosting the Loeries Creative Week for the fourth year running. About 3000 entries have been submitted, where the best on show will receive a Grand Prix Loerie. Jury presidents will fly in from Singapore, Germany and Mexico, with regional judges from the Middle East, Kenya, Nigeria and Namibia. The Loeries, which recognises creativity and innovation across Africa and the Middle East, is expected to contribute more than R130million to the local economy. Human is hopeful the Loeries will maintain last year’s R130m figure. “We are not in a boom time when you can expect growth; it’s about maintaining that financial position,” he said. One of the master classes will be a discussion on “KZN as an economic powerhouse”. Panellists will include Trade & Investment KZN, Tourism KZN and the Durban Chamber of Commerce. Daily News
