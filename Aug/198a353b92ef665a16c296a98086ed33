Durban - The strike action currently taking place at KZN Sharks Board has left a few beaches unprotected because there is not enough manpower at the centre. Mike Anderson-Reade, head of operations at KZN Sharks Board said the centre is currently experiencing industrial action with its labour force and as such has had to temporarily reduce the number of protected beaches the organisation is able to service with the limited resources available. “The Board will continue to render services to the best of its ability during this period,” Anderson-Reade said. “Visitors to the beaches are requested to check with the lifeguards prior to entering the water at any of the non-mentioned beaches,” he continued. Beaches that are open for swimming: North Coast: Willards Beach (Ballito Bay main beach) and Umhlanga Rocks main beach. Durban: Ushaka to Suncoast Beach inclusive. South Coast: Hibberdene, Umzumbe, Southport, St Michaels, Uvongo, Lucien, Margate, Ramsgate, Southbroom, San Lameer and Trafalgar. Daily News
