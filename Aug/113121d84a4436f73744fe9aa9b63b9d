Durban - Addington hospital cleaning staff members went on strike on Wednesday over what they allege are appalling working conditions at the facility. The KwaZulu-Natal health department employees allege that they were unable to keep the required hygiene standard due to lack of adequate cleaning equipment. “We have been raising this issue with the department for some time, but with no joy. The toilets are filthy and so are the wards. No proper cleaning equipment is made available to us and this doesn’t help in keeping the required standards of cleanliness of the facility. When inspections are done and the facility is found not to be squeaky clean, the employer is quick to blame us. We, therefore, say we refuse to work under such conditions,” said an unofficial spokesperson for the employees who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals. On July 27, the Daily News reported about the appalling conditions of the facility’s staff and student nurses quarters. At the time, the affected staff and student nurses had gone on strike over the conditions after no action was taken by the department to fix the problem. The spokesperson for the Department, Ncumisa Mafunda said: “There is an ongoing process of consultation between hospital Management and labour unions. However, the discussions are internal in nature and the issue is receiving attention from the Department. The Department wishes to emphasise that it holds hygiene and infection prevention and control in the highest regard as it is essential to the successful treatment and management of patients".
