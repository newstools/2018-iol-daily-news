Durban - The family of beleaguered National Director of Public Prosecutions have come to his defence in the wake of a Constitutional Court judgment that found that his appointment was invalid. Abrahams mother, Anne and his sister, Lynn Boucher who live in Pietermaritzburg - where Abrahams grew up - said he had their unwavering support. Anne said that her son did nothing wrong as he did not appoint himself to the position. "We don't make the laws and I believe Shaun was not involved in the selection of who should or should not be the NPA head," Anne said. The Constitutional Court ruled that Abrahams appointment by former President Jacob Zuma was unconstitutional. Constitutional Court Justice Mbuyiseli Madlanga ruled that Abrahams and the NPA pay the costs. Justice Madlanga said former president Zuma was conflicted when he appointed Abrahams. He labelled the latter a “beneficiary” of abuse of power by Zuma. The court also found the termination of Abraham’s predecessor Advocate Mxolisi Nxasana’s contract was invalid. Following a break down in Nxasana and Zuma’s relationship, and pressure to vacate his office, Nxasana later accepted a golden handshake of over R17m from Zuma. Justice Madlanga ruled that Nxasana pays R10 million back. Daily News
