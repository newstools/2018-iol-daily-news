Durban - The bail application for the man arrested in connection with the taxi massacre that killed 12 people -  has been postponed until next week. The man, who cannot be named by order of the court, faces charges of possession of ammunition and has been linked to the murders of the 12 people who were killed n the R74 between Colenso and Weenen. Gunmen peppered a minibus taxi carrying members of the Ivory-Park Taxi Association in Gauteng who were returning from a funeral. He appeared in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Monday. State prosecutor, Patrick Magoda said they planned to oppose bail for the accused. He said the accused was facing a number of other charges but could not name them as yet. Defence attorney Nolwazi Malimela said her client had been assaulted by police and had struggled earlier this week to talk to him about the case. She said she wanted the matter of bail to be dealt with urgently as her client has already been held in jail for more than seven days. In response, Magoda said he would not comment on the assault case, but from having a look at the accused's face, the accused did not show any signs of being beaten. Magoda had also asked for the media not to show his face as this would jeopardise investigations into the case. Magistrate Thembinkosi Ngema agreed the accused's identity should not be revealed until investigations were complete. The prosecutor said the accused was going to be given medical attention in prison. Ngema said the matter would be postponed until August 6 for a formal bail application. The Colenso killings were one of the most violent in recent history and have been the latest in a long line of killings that have plagued the taxi industry. Daily News
