Durban- The South African based Al-Imdaad Foundation is currently involved in efforts to help Indonesians who are still trying to recover from an earthquake that has devastated parts of the country. Independent Online has previously reported that the resort island of Lombok in the West Nusa Tenggara province was hit by a 6.9 magnitude earthquake earlier this month which resulted in more than 400 deaths. There have been numerous aftershocks since the earthquake which have resulted in residents living in a constant state of fear said one of Al-Imdaad’s team members who has been working on the ground since Monday and will be working on the ground until Sunday. In a statement, the organisation’s project co-ordinator, Pa Reza, said many of the houses in the area were made of a cheap low-quality material which made them more vulnerable to the earthquake. Aadam Badrudeen, who comes from the KwaZulu-Natal offices of the foundation, said it looked like all the houses had been flattened. He said residents were living in fear and that were still minor tremors happening in the region. “Every time the ground trembles, even if it’s just a motorbike driving past they hold on for their lives because of what they’ve been going through… One can’t imagine how traumatic it must be for them,” Badrudeen said. The teams helped locals with food supplies which included which consisted of rice and dried fish. In efforts to help as many people who were hit hard by the earthquake, the teams went to the epicentre of the earthquake in the Beyen sub-district where they saw the widespread destruction caused by the earthquake. “The teams also conducted a needs assessment in the badly affected village of Gumantar in the Kayangan sub-district where they returned the following day for food aid distributions. Further distributions were also undertaken in an area called Terjun which team members described as being completely flattened,” the foundation said. Daily News
