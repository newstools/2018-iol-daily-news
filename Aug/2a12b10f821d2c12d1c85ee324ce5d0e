With its distinctive red band atop its white lower section, the landmark uMhlanga tower is probably the most well-known, photographed and painted lighthouse in the country. McGowan though has a particular love for the uMhlanga lighthouse as he recalled spending many a day at the nearby beach cottage, “the last standing house on the promenade”, owned by the Porritt family, close friends of his family since the 1940s. “Until recent years, the house was between the Beverly Hills Hotel and where The Pearls stands today,” he said. McGowan’s most recent work has been sold to an uMhlanga-based friend. The unmanned, fully automatic uMhlanga lighthouse, which took four days and 19 hours to construct, was commissioned in November 1954 at R23 838. It is 21 metres in height and 25m above the high water mark. The range of its light is 24 sea miles. Its fixed red light enables ships waiting in the outer anchorage to monitor their positions. If the red light can be seen, it suggests a ship’s anchors have probably dragged and it is too close to the shore. The nearby Oyster Box Hotel, which dates back to 1869 and was the first beach cottage in the area, is the official warden/custodian (the red-painted roof of the hotel was used as a beacon by ships at sea to indicate their proximity to the land before the lighthouse was built). A hotel spokesman said ­yesterday that the lighthouse controls were once kept in the hotel office, and monitored by staff, who reported to Portnet. The controls are now with Durban’s Ports Authority, while the hotel remains the “custodian”. Daily News
