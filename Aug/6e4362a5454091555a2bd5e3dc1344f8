Durban - Three suspects are due to appear in the Umzinto Magistrates Court for dealing in cannabis plants and oil on Wednesday. Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo, a spokesperson for the Hawks in KwaZulu-Natal, said a multi-disciplinary team comprising of the Hawks, Crime Intelligence and Tactical Response Team arrested the three after it transpired that there was group operating a clandestine hydroponic laboratory in Ellingham Estate Farm. The members swooped at the premises and seized cannabis plants, oil and equipment valued close to half a million rand. Two weeks ago, police raided a house on Meerut Road, Westville where they found three rooms that were used for hydroponic dagga labs. South African Police from the eThekwini inner and outer west cluster narcotics team together with crime Intelligence members at Westville area stormed the house. They found about 50 plants of dagga at the scene. Two people were arrested. Recently police found dagga with a street value of more than R61 000 in the Bluff, south of Durban. They then raided a home in Glenwood. Five suspects were arrested in total for the Bluff bust. According to Wikipedia, hydroponics is the art of growing plants without soil. When most people think of growing marijuana hydroponically, they think of growing their plants with their roots suspended directly into the water with absolutely no growing medium. The sale of this type of dagga has become popular with several undercover labs being busted by police. Daily News
