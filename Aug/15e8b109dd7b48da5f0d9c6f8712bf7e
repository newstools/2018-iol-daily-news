Durban - South African deputy president, David Mabuza, on Monday witnessed the signing of a Declaration of Intent by four major agricultural unions; AgriSA, AFASA, NAFU-SA and TAU-SA. The statement of intent moves to strengthen ties within the sector and develop a national strategy for the country's agricultural sector. Monday's signing is a step towards an agricultural indaba set to take place in November. Under the umbrella of the African Farmers' Association of SA, the unions will build trust in the sector and work up a national strategy. According to a statement released by the four unions, they want to develop a national strategy for the agriculture sector from the perspective of organised agriculture. “We have had a number of high level interactions as presidents of our four organisations and have done serious introspection. We have noted the parliamentary process on expropriation without compensation and are all participating in the process,” the statement read. The members added that whilst they were cognisant of the National Development Plan and Operation Phakisa’s outcomes and many other important documents and processes, they want to build trust within the sector and come up with a national strategy that will address a number of concerns that they have agreed on.
