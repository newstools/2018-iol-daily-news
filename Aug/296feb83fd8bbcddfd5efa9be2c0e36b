Durban - The first milestone in the R1.6bn redevelopment of the Suncoast beachfront attraction-the opulent Art Deco-inspired Salon Privé -has officially opened. Hailed as a "true icon in the Tsogo Sun stable and in the world of gaming," the salon, located on the upper level boasts 180-degree sea views and is almost three times the size of the previous venue. It is just one part of the massive redevelopment which has been underway for the past 18 months and which is due to be finished in early December. By then the entertainment offerings will have been increased to include 22 restaurants-including Mexican and Portuguese fare-a Barnyard Theatre, a retail area and a multi-purpose event facility. More than 600 new underground parking bays will also be added, while there will be a total of 1 850 slots and 71 tables. The hotel will also have been refurbished by then. "It's been a long road, but the light at the end of the tunnel is now just a few months away," said Mike Dowsley, the Suncoast executive director. Guest of honour at the opening of the Prive Salon on Thursday, Sihle Zikalala, the MEC for economic development, tourism and environmental affairs, said that the Suncoast development had been one of the country's major investment since 1994. "It is a vote of confidence for the province and the growth of the economy of KZN," he told guests. Daily News
