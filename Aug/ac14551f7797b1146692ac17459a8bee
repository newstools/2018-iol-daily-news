The SA Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) defined depression as “a whole-body illness, involving your body, mood and thoughts” and “is not something that can be willed or wished away”. According to psychiatrist Dr Kim Laxton, the symptoms are negative thoughts, change in sleep patterns, difficulty in concentrating, increased self-medication and suicidal thoughts. Lori Barausse, a group leader at Survivors of Suicide of Loved Ones, said some myths pertaining to suicide were: “It happens without warning, is limited to white men and people who suffer from mental illness.” Laxton recommended the following for those suffering from depression: contact the Sadag call centre; reach out to a person or friend, explain how you feel; see your doctor; take medication and adhere to treatment programmes; and journal your mental health story. Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University in Pretoria announced yesterday that it would host Mayosi’s memorial service tomorrow. Dr Richard Friedland, the chief executive of the health-care group Netcare said: “We express our sincere condolences to Professor Mayosi’s family and loved ones. He has left an indelible footprint and enduring legacy in the medical landscape in South Africa, and will be deeply missed by all who had the privilege to know him.” Sufferers of depression can call the Lifeline Crisis Line at 0313122323 or Sadag’s crisis line at 0800121314.
