Durban - The body of a man washed up on a pier in Richards Bay on Saturday, prompting speculation that it could be that of the missing KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board employee who went missing after the boat he was in capsized. The body was taken away by authorities and is yet to be identified. Local fishermen spotted the body floating near the pier in Alkantstrand on Saturday and alerted authorities. The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) had retrieved the body. Siyabonga Gabela, a KZN Sharks Board employee went missing a week ago when the boat he was in with four others capsized in rough seas. His colleagues Eric Buthelezi and Siniseko Ngobese survived the ordeal. They were rescued by lifeguards. Richard Gumede and Mandlakayise Gumede died. They were carrying out routine shark net servicing when huge waves tipped the boat over. Eric Buthelezi, one of the survivors, confirmed that a body has been found but he could not confirm if it was Gabela. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, KZN Police spokesperson, said the body was taken to the mortuary for further investigation. He said police have not identified the body as yet. Mike Anderson Reade, KZN Sharks board spokesperson, said the body was not yet identified and therefore he could not comment. A source told the Daily News that the body had been badly decomposed. The crew was responsible for servicing the shark safety gear which protects Newark Beach which is closest to the northern breakwater. Daily News
