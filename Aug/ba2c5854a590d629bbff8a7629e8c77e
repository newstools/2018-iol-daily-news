Durban- One person died and three were arrested in a shootout between police and criminals in the Maphumulo area, north of Durban. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala, said the shootout happened after police were doing follow-ups on a shooting incident that happened on Wednesday where four security guards were robbed of 13 guns. “Whilst attending to the shooting complaint, Maphumulo police were joined by ILembe Cluster members and suspects driving the stolen Tata vehicle were spotted in the Maphumulo policing precinct. When the suspects saw the police, there was an exchange of gunfire which resulted in the death of one suspect, the arrest of three suspects and the recovery of eight firearms,” she said. No police officers were injured during the firefight and they were expecting to make arrests soon. The captured suspects were expected to make an appearance soon. "They will be charged for attempted murder, illegal possession of firearms, possession of stolen property and robbery," Gwala said. A woman who asked not to be named said she was shocked by the incident. The 62-year-old who lives than 10 metres away from where the incident happened  said she was preparing her grandchildren to go to school. “We then heard shots being fired. I told my two grandchildren that they must not leave the house until things had quieted down," the woman said. She said her grandchildren were still shocked and that this was the first time this sort of thing happened near her home. She said she knew the suspect and that he was a well-known criminal in the area. “The shootout was like it was fireworks going off because of the volume of bullets being fired,” she said. Daily News
