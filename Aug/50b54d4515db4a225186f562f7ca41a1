Durban - Scores of community members packed the Durban Magistrate's Court on Tuesday in anticipation of the bail hearing of the man allegedly linked to the disappearance of 10-year-old Miguel Louw. The 43-year-old man, whom the magistrate has ruled cannot be named until an identity parade is conducted was due to make his third appearance on Tuesday. Initially charged with kidnapping, the charges were changed to human trafficking at his court appearance last week. Among those who packed courtroom 10 is the man's father who has come to support the family of Miguel. The courtroom was full with supporters of Miguel's family that Magistrate Ahmed Motala asked them to step out in a bid to free up the courtroom for other cases that were in progress. "The file is currently upstairs with the senior prosecutors who are discussing the matter, please may you leave and you will be called in when the matter starts," he asked. Seated at the front of the gallery right behind the dock are Miguel's mother and grandmother. Several other family members, some carrying posters were at court and protested outside. Miguel was last seen outside his school in Sydenham on July 17. According to his family, CCTV footage from a nearby fast food outlet put him in the company of the 43-year-old man. The family has put up a R50 000 reward for Miguel's safe return. Daily News
