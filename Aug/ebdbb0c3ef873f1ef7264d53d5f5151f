Ncumisa Ndelu, the spokesperson for the Durban march, said she was pleased with the turnout. "Today we stand with those who were and are victims of abuse.  We are not here to represent any political party, that is why we are dressed in black and red. We are here to say enough is enough. We are taking a stand against women abuse, child abuse and abuse in all forms. We will not take this anymore," she said. Cookie Edwards, a well known Durban activist, was also present at the march. "I am here to show my support for this gathering. We are the voice of the voiceless.
