Durban - KwaZulu-Natal police have taken their search for Miguel Louw to Port Shepstone after there were reports about him being spotted down the south coast. The South Coast Herald reported that messages posted on a local WhatsApp group stated that Miguel had been seen at the Port Shepstone taxi rank last Friday. It was also said that Miguel was with a 'coloured' man and urged people to be on the lookout for the boy. Provincial police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said police did make enquires after receiving the information. “Police have made inquiries around the Port Shepstone Taxi rank from a trolley pusher as well as the car guards and have no valid information regarding the missing child,” Zwane said. There is a R50 000 reward for anyone who finds and returns Miguel to his family. Miguel was allegedly kidnapped after school while making his way home. Video footage emerged of Miguel and a man he seemed to be familiar with at a local eatery. The last footage shows the man pulling Miguel towards a taxi. The man has since been arrested and faces a charge of human trafficking. A huge billboard of Miguel can be seen from the N3 highway when entering and exiting the city.
