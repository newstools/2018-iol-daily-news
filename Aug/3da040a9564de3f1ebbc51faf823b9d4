Durban - A hole in the flipper of a sub-Antarctic fur seal rescued by the KZN Stranding Network was most likely a bullet wound and most likely inflicted by a fisherman over a "catch", the network said. “Conflict between the fishing industry and seals is not new in South Africa. The conflict is essentially about ‘who gets the fish’," KZN Stranding Network said in a Facebook post on their Facebook page "There are two types of conflict interactions between seals and the fishing industry: 1) competition for a common resource (being the fish) between two "predators" and 2) operational conflicts which occur during fishing operations, where seals take fish directly from fishing nets, which would have otherwise been caught by the fishermen or the seal disrupt operations and damage equipment,” the post said. The KZN Strandings Network said that in 1992 it was estimated that 10 921 seals were intentionally shot and killed by the commercial fishing industry. The cost of the fishing industry was estimated at approximately R3.4 million. “However, what could not be quantified was the cost to the fishing industry in terms of vessel and manpower time in which crew were having to deal with seals during operations,” the post continued.
