Durban - Ninety-three per cent of people polled on Facebook by the Daily News says the students of the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) Westville campus were justified in protesting their living conditions this week. This after pictures of holes in roofs, rat-infested lodgings, damp walls and leaking taps were published by the Daily News. Students took to the streets this week over the living conditions which led to  UKZN suspending its academic programme at the Westville campus until Friday. The Daily News asked its online audience, "Do you think UKZN Westville campus students have valid reasons to protest over their student accommodation?" Of the 400 people who voted on the 24-hour poll which ended on Friday, only seven per cent said they did not agree with the students protest. Students at the campus complained of bed bugs, no hot water and over 300 women students sharing eight functioning bathrooms. The campus has 16 bathrooms. Students also said that rats had made holes in the building and some also eat the personal belongings of students.  Daily News
