This was in reaction to the city’s plan to convert Joseph Shabalala’s and Griffiths Mxenge’s family homes in Clermont and uMlazi, respectively, into museums. Mxenge was a civil rights lawyer who was abducted, bludgeoned and stabbed to death in uMlazi in November 1981. Shabalala is the founder of the Grammy Award-winning group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. According to a report tabled at the city’s executive committee this week, the city’s Parks, Recreation and Culture Department, together with the Real Estate department, were instructed to consult the two families with a view to acquiring the houses through a lease agreement. Mdu Nkosi, an IFP councillor, said the challenge with projects like this was that the ANC-led council was biased. “It doesn’t want to recognise all freedom fighters and heritage icons,” Nkosi said. The DA said it supported the report, and was generally supportive of measures to promote and protect culture and history. “The history of South Africa has not always been fairly represented, and the DA supports measures to correct that,” said Nicole Graham, DA eThekwini chief whip. In 2010, the provincial government had made available R10million for the construction of the 1860 Indentured Labourer Monument in Durban, and the project never materialised. Shameen Rajbansi, leader of the Minority Front, said it made no sense to attach the political Struggle to one party. Daily News
