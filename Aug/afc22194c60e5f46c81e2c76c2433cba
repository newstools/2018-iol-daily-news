Clive Pillay, president of the club, said Naidoo was handed the Revolution Achievement award for his role in promoting human rights and his appointment at the amnesty international. Pillay, whose organisation is community orientated, said they have been awarding people from across all walks of life in the past few years. "Naidoo and many other community activists are role models young people should emulate and engage with. Kumi's speech was full of anecdotes of the struggle, life in Chatsworth, his engagement with global leaders/ activists, and his new job," Pillay said. Kiru Naidoo, a community activist who attended the event, said Kumi encouraged them to be engaged in activism in human rights, environment and food security. Naidoo told the Daily News that he was humbled by the award. "Chatsworth is where I began dabbling in activism. The place taught me how to contribute to public life. Whenever I am in Durban I assist the club in whatever way I can. They are involved in positive community work. I met many old friends at the event which I was chuffed about," Naidoo said. He encouraged people to become part of the solution and look at ways to contribute to the upliftment of society and others. Amnesty International is a global movement of people who take injustice personally. We are campaigning for a world where human rights are enjoyed by all.Kumi is also an avid biker and is a member of Revolution MC Daily News
