Durban - “This is a big thing to us, yes it's a sad moment but also a moment where we can breathe a sigh of relief knowing we will be able to lay his body to rest”. These are the words to Siqiniseko Ngobese, one of the KZN Sharks Board employees who survived when the boat he and four of his colleagues were in capsized on August 25. He spoke to the Daily News, on Tuesday, after the board confirmed that the body of a man that was found on Saturday near the pier in Alkantstrand belongs to Siyabonga Gabela who had still been missing. Richard Gumede and Mandlakayise Gumede died. They were carrying out routine shark net servicing when tragedy struck. Ngobese and Eric Buthelezi survived the ordeal, they were rescued by lifeguards. Gabela's body had been missing since the incident and on Saturday local fishermen spotted a body floating near the pier in Alkantstrand on Saturday and alerted authorities. The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) retrieved the body. Sharks Board Business Development Executive Harry Mbambo said on Thursday a memorial service will be held for Gabela at the KZN Sharks Board Bay Station in Richards Bay. Richard Gumede and Mandlakayise Gumede were laid to rest at the weekend. Daily News
