This information was revealed, on Tuesday, in the Durban Magistrate’s Court where the man arrested in connection with Miguel’s disappearance made his formal bail application. “We all have one goal here, to find Miguel, and the more people are on board to help find him, the better. However, in doing this, communication is important so that we can work together because no one can do this on their own,” said Miguel’s aunt, Tashmin dos Santos, outside court. She said they believed Miguel was still alive. “The police need to work harder to get evidence,” she said. Magistrate Mahomed Motala expressed his concern for the boy, who was still missing after four weeks. “The State must do everything in its power because there’s still a young boy missing,” Motala told prosecutor Patrick Magoda. The State requested a seven-day postponement to allow for further investigations by the new team. Motala warned the State about a further postponement, saying the investigation process should not infringe on the constitutional rights of the accused. The man, who cannot be named until an identity parade has been conducted, yesterday complained he was being assaulted while in custody at the Durban North police station. “I did this previously as well and I am doing it again. I appeal to you, if you know where the child is, please, please bring it to the attention of the authorities for your sake and for those people affected,” said Motala to the man after telling him he would be moved to Westville Prison. He is expected back in court on August 29 for his bail application. Meanwhile, there is a R50000 reward for anyone who might have information on the whereabouts of Miguel. The reward is being offered jointly by the family and community members who have contributed to the fund. Anyone with information on Miguel’s whereabouts can contact Crimestop: 086 00 10111.
