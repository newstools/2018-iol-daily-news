Durban - A 52-year-old man has been handed a life sentence after brutally murdering a student from the University of Zululand last year. The murderer, Bhekuyise Mngoma, was sentenced to life imprisonment at the Mthunzini High Court and handed a further five years for kidnapping student Lethukuthula Ngobese, 21. Ngobese, who was a third year law student, had been missing from July last year when her decomposed body was found with multiple stab wounds in a shack in September last year. Neighbours had alerted police to an odour which came from the shack where the woman student was killed by Mngoma. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Zwane said Mngoma was the owner of the shack. “The accused who was the owner of the home, was not present at the time of the discovery of the body. He was later arrested and charged with murder and kidnapping. He was convicted after the court heard how he killed an Ongoye University student last year,” said Zwane.
