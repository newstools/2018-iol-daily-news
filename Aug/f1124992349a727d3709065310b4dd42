This was after the bail application of SANDF soldier Mandla Zondi, accused of killing Majola - the mother of his two children - was postponed again in the Hammarsdale Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Zondi allegedly shot dead Majola, 36, in their home on July 27 and told Majola’s family when they arrived that she had killed herself. Majola taught at Khulawemuke Primary School. In court yesterday, the defence was expected to cross-examine the investigating officer, but the State applied for a postponement instead, saying there was new evidence that the investigating officer had uncovered, which needed to be led in court. Zondi’s defence advocate, Jaci Gates, had objected to the postponement saying it was unfair for the State to bring in new evidence just before cross-examination. Magistrate S Patan granted the postponement until Friday. Speaking outside court, the Majola family spokesperson, Lindiwe Madlala, said they were satisfied that something was going on with the case. “As long as justice is done at the end of the day, we don’t care about the delays,” she said.
