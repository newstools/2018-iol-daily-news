Durban - The Daily News readers have spoken, the Constitutional Court was correct in its decision to dismiss now former National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) boss, Shaun Abrahams. On Monday the Daily News asked its Facebook followers whether they thought the Constitutional Court was right or not to dismiss Abrahams. A whopping 80 percent said they felt the decision was correct while 20 percent said it was incorrect.   On Monday Justice Mbuyiseli Madlanga ruled that Abrahams’s appointment by former president Jacob Zuma through “the abuse of power”, had been unconstitutional and invalid. While his appeal against a High Court ruling was dismissed with costs. The Constitutional Court also ruled the departure of former National National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Mxolisi Nxasana illegal, after receiving a R17 million golden handshake. After news of Abrahams broke, Twitter requested President Cyril Ramaphosa to consider hiring former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela as the new director of public prosecutions.
