Durban -Twenty refuse bags were filled with litter that was found on the banks of the Palmiet nature reserve river by volunteers who gave of their time to clean up the area this week. Gareth Preiss said he volunteered some of his time with a staff member Brian Zulu to pick up litter on the river banks.  The most common items found were plastic shopping packets, chip packets, sweet wrappers, plastic bottles and polystyrene packaging. "What is sad is that most of this litter is what is thrown on our roads and sidewalks which then gets washed down storm drains and into the river, ultimately ending up in the ocean. The solution is so simple - use a bin!" he said. Preiss encouraged people who visit nature reserves to pick up some litter while on your walk. "Together we can make a difference," he added. The Palmiet Nature Reserve is located in Westville which forms part of the eThekweni (Durban) Metro Region of South Africa.  According to the Palmiet Nature reserve website, the reserve and river is named after the riverine plant Prionium serratum (Palmiet) which was once abundant in the area. The Palmiet Valley was well known to the original families from Germany who settled here in 1848. It was through this wild rugged valley that they travelled to attend church or to visit friends in neighbouring New Germany. The route followed the present day Old New Germany Road, which is now the starting point of the Palmiet Trail into the Nature Reserve. An interesting description of the Palmiet Valley is given in the book "Letters of a Natal Sheriff" edited by R.N. Currey. It appeared in the"Natal Witness" on the 11th April 1851 written by Thomas Phipson. He describes the road between Durban and New Germany. The website stated that the Palmiet dates back some 200 years. A wild and untamed place full of pythons and leopards. The geology page goes back 300 million years showing how the Palmiet evolved from a desert through an ice age with glaciers to the present day. Daily News
