Durban - A gang of robbers smashed their way into a Durban North bottle store after holding up the security guards on Thursday morning. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a KZN Police spokesperson said the robbers held the security guards up at gunpoint. The robbers then tied the guards up with rope outside the Tops store in Browns Drift Road. "They took liquor and fled in their getaway vehicle. A case of robbery is being investigated by Greenwood Park SAPS. Police are still searching for the suspects and gathering information regarding the incident," Zwane said. Police could not confirm if the robbers were linked to the notorious hammer gang that have been smashing their way into stores. The brazen gang have also carried out their robberies inside shopping malls. A gang of robbers, armed with hammers struck a jewellery counter inside Game at the City View shopping centre in Greyville in August 2017. In September 2017 the hammer gang armed with sledgehammers pounded their way through the glass doors of Checkers Liquor Shop at a Virginia shopping centre. A gang using hammers targetted several jewellery stores across KwaZulu-Natal. Police set up a provincial mall robbery task team to investigate the incidents. Daily News
