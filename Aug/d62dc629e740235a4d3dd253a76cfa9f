Durban - Why a baby whale washed up on a beach in eManzimtoti remains a mystery. But marine experts will on Tuesday probe exactly what caused the sub-adult humpback whale to wash up on Pipeline Beach. The whale died soon after thrashing about in shallow water early this morning. Jennifer Olbers, a  Marine Ecologist at Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife said whales were more exposed to coming on shore during low tide. The South African Association for Marine Biological Research (SAAMBR) website said dolphins and whales may strand along the beaches of KwaZulu Natal for many reasons that may be natural or as a result of human activities. Some of these reasons include disease, old age or parasitic infection, abandoned calves, or malnourished juveniles; severe oceanographic and weather conditions or they may have been bitten by predators such as sharks or orcas. Human activities include pollution or an injury from fishing gear or boats. Daily News
