Rhana Naicker, the executive, and Ndabezinhle Luthuli appeared in the Durban Commercial Crime Court on Tuesday on fraud and forgery charges. According to the draft charge sheet, it is alleged that the pair defrauded a DrPChetty between 2015 and 2016 by convincing him that Naicker would be investing in Ziqoqe Construction, a company Luthuli owned. Chetty was apparently led to believe that the company was awarded a tender to build low-cost housing by the Ladysmith Municipality and that he was the implementing agent of the housing project. Chetty was allegedly told the funds would be paid into Ziqoqe’s account and it would be used to cover legitimate costs of the housing project. “The accused forged a tax invoice that wrongly reflected the bank account of Naicker who was involved in giving this fraudulent tax invoice,” read the charge sheet. It is alleged Luthuli did not win a tender with the municipality and that the funds would not help to provide employment for Chetty’s brother. “The funds invested by DrPChetty would not be used to cover legitimate costs of the Colenso low-cost housing project. (Naicker) committed fraud and knowingly forged a document with the incorrect details and passed it on as being true,” the charge sheet stated. Naicker and Luthuli are currently on bail of R10000 and R20000 respectively. In her bail application, Naicker said she was living with her 18-year-old son in Richards Bay, she was the sole breadwinner in the family and that her son had been in poor health which resulted in him having to be home-schooled. She said she had no previous convictions and had no pending cases and had intended to plead not guilty to the charges. Luthuli, in his bail application, said he had three children, and had a company that did not have any permanent employees. He worked with them as and when needed. The matter was adjourned until September to confirm Luthuli’s financial details. Daily News
