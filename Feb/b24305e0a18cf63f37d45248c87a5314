Durban - During the eThekwini Municipality’s Governance and Human Resources Committee meeting, welcome boards at King Shaka International Airport (KSIA) was one of the recommendations made to the Executive Committee for approval. The committee supported the installation of welcome boards at the airport as part of welcoming visitors to Durban. Tozi Mthethwa, Head of Communications at the municipality, said the branding at the airport will allow visitors to know what eThekwini offers. “This will also encourage tourists to visit attractions that the city and the province offers. The welcome boards will entice visitors to ask questions and learn about the city and province while increasing the tourism,” said Mthethwa. Mthethwa said KSIA is the third busiest airport in South Africa, after O.R Tambo International Airport and Cape Town International Airport. She said in 2016/17, the KSIA recorded 4.8 million passengers with the majority of 4.18 million being domestic passengers and 277 866 being international and a small percentage of traffic being classified as “unscheduled”.
