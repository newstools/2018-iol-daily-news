Durban - Dreams came true on Monday night for many South Africans when President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed Bheki Cele as the Minister of Police. Ramaphosa shuffled his cabinet and the introduction of Cele saw the back of Fikile Mbalula, as a cabinet minister. Near the end of 2014, many South Africans were calling for the return of Cele. Here is how Tweeps reacted to the new Minister of Police, #BhekiCele:  Don't care why he was fired before but my prayers have been answered. The general is back 🙌🏽🙌🏽 #BhekiCele pic.twitter.com/fMj11ctPoL  — Babayega (@Lindo_MbejeSr) February 27, 2018   #BhekiCele AYEYE MR CHEST OUT STOMACH IN IS BACK pic.twitter.com/W4SXjTQg5U  — MSICK BEATS (@MsickBeats) February 27, 2018    #BhekiCele i feel safe already  — ThE fundRaiser (@Dakalobling) February 27, 2018    The police department will never be the same again.

However, in 2012 he was officially fired from the position by former president Jacob Zuma. Later, Zuma hired him as the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, until Ramaphosa made him Minister of Police in his first cabinet reshuffle following Zuma’s resignation. Cele has also served as MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison in KwaZulu-Natal and was a member of the National Executive Committee of the ANC. Cele is also the founding member for the National Education Union of South Africa and serves as a member of the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Legislature and a member of the KwaZulu-Natal Executive Council.
