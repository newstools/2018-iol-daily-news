Durban - Some media houses have been talking about how Nando's was able to predict what would happen to the Gupta's and with a number plate personalised "WE RUN", it's easy to think Nando's had predicted the future. However, they have not explored that the advert reveals much more than just the last scene where two “Gupta” brothers appear to be getting ready to leave the country with large bags of money, luggage and a portrait of Ajay and Atul Gupta. The entire advert reflects South Africa, past and present. Nando's published the advert on 11 December 2017, fast forward to two months later, and there are protests outside Luthuli House in Johannesburg and the Gupta’s are on the run. The Nando's advert which "predicted" the Gupta's going on the run. From the beginning, the advert takes a look at the then state of South Africa - politics, sport, lifestyle - and events that made news headlines over the last few years. The advert tries to cover the most important events that took place in South Africa since the release of Nelson Mandela in 1990. The advert also covers - illegal street adverts, sports matches (and vuvuzela’s), athletics (and broken records), Jacob Zuma and Julius Malema’s broken relationship, sign language at Nelson Mandela’s memorial service, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Nkandla, #PayBackTheMoney, cabinet reshuffle (finance ministers), shaving eyebrows and drawing them, world’s first heart transplant, Schabir Shaik attacks a journalist, Thuli Madonsela’s state capture report, unique SA news headlines, Doom pastor (and vloggers), climbing MT. Everest, protesting outside Luthuli House and Gupta’s on the run. Nando's is not only famous for their flame-grilled chicken but they are also famous for their political adverts. The above advert is just one of many adverts that will be etched in the minds of many South Africans.
