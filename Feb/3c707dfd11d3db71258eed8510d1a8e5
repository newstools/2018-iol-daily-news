Residents are upset that the department is not finding them alternative accommodation. Some people were forced to sleep in bushes. One of the tenants being affected is Marie Davis. The 40-year-old said her mother was among the 14 people who live in her two-room house. “I have nowhere to go. They promised us decanted housing, but nothing has happened,” she said. The mother of five, who also is responsible for her late sister’s children, said it was difficult getting by because they lived on social grants. Another resident, Ursula Brower, said refurbishments had been taking place for the past two years. She said the community was told that they would have to find their own accommodation. Other residents complained about poor workmanship on houses being refurbished. They also complained that the asbestos removed from their houses was not disposed of properly. They said the asbestos would pose a health risk to children playing near their homes. Mbulelo Baloyi, provincial Human Settlements spokesperson, said in 2016 the department had approved funding for 10 temporary housing facilities. “Due to the delay in securing a suitable service site, the quotation for this work has since expired and therefore rendered the approval null and void,” Baloyi said. A change in policy and a shift in funding from the national Department of Human Settlements had made it difficult to provide more than the 225 completed decanting units. “To proceed to provide temporary housing to the balance of 95 units will not be feasible, and the process to obtain this temporary housing and construct will take six months,” Baloyi said. They, however, had not received any complaints of shoddy workmanship. “When the unit is completed it is checked by the department together with the contractor,” Baloyi said. Daily News
