Durban - The Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) is set to oversee the election of traditional councils in May.
Bheki Mkhize, a Cogta representative, presented the department's plans to the eThekwini Municipality's Executive Committee (Exco) on Tuesday morning. He said the election of the traditional councils were not without their challenges. “The IEC will be charged with handling the elections as it is the credible institution for that. The elections will be held in May and the department (Cogta) will ensure that all people who reside under all amakhosi jurisdiction, participate in the elections,” Mkhize said. He said among the challenges was that of landless amakhosi as this made it hard for the subjects to find a place to vote and that in some cases inkosi resided in one area while someone else was an overseer of another area under the same jurisdiction. Cogta sent condolences to councillor Mfundo Mthenjane who served as the Speaker of the uMhlathuze local municipality in Richards Bay, Northern KwaZulu-Natal. In a statement on Tuesday morning, Cogta MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube said Mthenjane was a well-known community activist with a “prolific record” in the struggle and community development passed away yesterday after a short illness. “Today as the local government fraternity in KwaZulu-Natal. We mourn the loss of a champion of community development, whose work and contribution has given hope and reality of freedom to many communities in uMhlathuze. Mthenjane died after a short illness. History will remember councillor Mthenjane as a gifted leader, a patriot and a true servant of the people especially in the Esikhaleni area where he honed his leadership acumen,” Dube-Ncube said. She said the department was in contact with the bereaved family regarding the funeral arrangements and, once confirmed, these will be communicated to the public. Daily News
