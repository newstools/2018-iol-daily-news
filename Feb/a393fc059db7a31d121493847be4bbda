Durban - The Eshowe Regional Court convicted and sentenced a man to a total of 45 years for the crimes he committed. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, police spokesperson, said Bonginkosi Nxumalo, 33, was convicted and sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for two counts of armed robbery, 15 years for attempted murder and five years for possession of unlicensed firearm. “On 1 March 2016, four suspects approached Imfezi security guards who were collecting cash from one of the supermarket at Eshowe. The suspects overpowered the security guards and took an undisclosed amount of cash in boxes as well as a rifle and a 9mm pistol. As they were exiting the shop, they opened fire and the security guards retaliated, fatally wounding one suspect. Cash taken during the robbery was recovered after they dropped the boxes. The other three managed to flee the scene,” said Mbhele. She said that after investigation, two men were arrested and were found in possession of an unlicensed firearm. She also said both men were charged with two counts of armed robbery, attempted murder and possession of unlicensed firearm. “One of the arrested suspects escaped from lawful custody. Eventually the court convicted and sentenced one accused, Bonginkosi Nxumalo. The escaped suspect was later re-arrested and he is still facing charges against him. The third suspect is still at large and the police are still searching for him,” she said. Major General Bheki Langa, KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner said, “This sentence demonstrates that the police in the province are determined in protecting the citizens of this province. We will make sure that all those who are behind this robbery are brought to book.” Daily News
