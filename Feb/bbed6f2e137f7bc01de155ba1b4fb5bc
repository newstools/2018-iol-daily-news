Durban - Two men were arrested by members of the Empangeni K9 Unit for a robbery on Maxwell Street on Sunday. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said when members of the unit arrived at the scene, they saw two men running away from the shop in different directions. “The police gave chase on foot. The suspects then produced firearms and allegedly shot at the officers. The police retaliated in self-defence, wounding one suspect on the body and another suspect was arrested,” said Zwane. He said two 9mm pistols, 15 rounds of ammunition and an undisclosed amount of cash were recovered from the men. The men were charged with business robbery, and being in possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. The injured man is still in hospital under police guard. Zwane said the men would appear in Empangeni Magistrate’s Court soon. The KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major-General Bheki Langa, praised the officers for their swift arrest of the suspects and recovery of the firearms and stolen cash. “We will make sure that we thoroughly investigate these cases and send well-prepared dockets to court for a successful prosecution. These firearms will be subjected to ballistic testing to ascertain if they were used to commit any other crime in the country,” said Langa. Daily News
