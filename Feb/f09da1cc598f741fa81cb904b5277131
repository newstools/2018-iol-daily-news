Durban - Police are on the hunt for a gang of men who crawled some 200 metres through a sewage tunnel in the hopes of stealing cash from an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) inside a Ladysmith supermarket earlier this week. However, despite their attempts, the ATM was not damaged. It is alleged that the men climbed down into the sewer and trekked through 280m of the pipe. According to a source, the men then dug a 6m trench and climbed up into the shop, situated in Alexandra Street.
