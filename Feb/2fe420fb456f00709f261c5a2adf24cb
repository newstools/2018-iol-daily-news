During an oversight visit on Friday to a building at 85 Berta Mkhize (Victoria) Street, deputy mayor Fawzia Peer said “gross safety violations” were uncovered. Peer, the chairperson of the city’s security and emergency services committee, had since served the building owner with a non-compliance notice. “The structure is used as an informal student accommodation constructed with flammable polystyrene partitioning,” Peer said. She said she was shocked to learn that the building had no dedicated emergency routes. Referring to a fire that started at a cellphone shop on the ground floor of the building, she said: “If it wasn’t for our Fire and Emergency Services Unit that managed to get to the scene within five minutes and put out the blaze, people would have died.” The owner has one month to remedy the transgressions. Hoosen Moolla, the chairperson of the Inner City Thekwini Regeneration and Urban Management Programme, said occupants from the second floor up to the 13th floor were unable to escape because the fire escape had been turned into trading areas. “As for the universities, it is their responsibility to ensure that building owners comply with by-laws before reaching an agreement to rent,” Moolla said. The building is leased by the Durban University of Technology (DUT) for student accommodation. Students gathered next to the building on Monday said that they paid R13 500 per semester. About 200 students occupy the rooms. Alan Khan, DUT’s corporate affairs senior director, referred the Daily News to the university’s communications unit for comment. Attempts to get comment from the building owner, only identified as Kazzie, were unsuccessful. Daily News
