Durban - The Hollywoodbets Dolphins and the Warriors shared the Momentum One Day Cup title after two days of rain at Sahara Stadium Kingsmead. The final was scheduled to take place on Friday at 1.30pm. However, lightning forced players off the pitch after the Dolphins had limped to 154 for six in 39.4 overs. Later, thunder and heavy rain kept the players off the pitch and persistent drizzle forced the umpires to call the match off, forcing the final to be played on Saturday, the reserve day. Unfortunately, not a ball was bowled on the reserve day and the title had to be shared by the two teams. It became the third shared title in three years. In the 2012/13 season, the Cape Cobras and Lions shared the title and in the following season, the Cape Cobras and the Titans. The Dolphins had reached the final by beating the Cape Cobras at Newlands, while the Warriors pulled off an unexpected victory against the Titans. The Dolphins had never won a 50-over title before, and had waited 16 years to host a final at Kingsmead. For the Warriors, it was their first trophy since winning in the 2009/10 season. The Dolphins now shift their focus to the Sunfoil Series, where they currently sit fifth on the log, with five matches still to be played. On Thursday the Dolphins head to Kimberlyâ€™s Diamond Oval where they will face the VKB Knights. Daily News
