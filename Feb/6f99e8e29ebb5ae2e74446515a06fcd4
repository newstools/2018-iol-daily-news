Durban - Police have warned the public not to take matters into their own hands but to let justice take its course. The warning comes after five people were arrested for allegedly assaulting a man, they believed to be a criminal. Major General Bheki Langa, KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, said it was unacceptable for citizens to break the law. "We appreciate the involvement of communities in assisting the police to fight crime but we are disappointed by those who take the law into their own hands. Suspects who are sought or suspected to be involved in criminal activities should be handed over to the police if they are arrested by those making a citizen’s arrest,” he said. According to Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, the five men allegedly assaulted the deceased in KwaMashu earlier this month. He sustained fatal injuries and a case of murder was opened. "Through police investigations, the men were linked to the murder case. More arrests are expected to be made as the matter is still under investigation," he said. The accused are due to appear in court this week. Daily News
