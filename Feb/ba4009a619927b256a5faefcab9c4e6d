Durban - A greater collective effort  and the implementation of the Paris Agreement are needed to mitigate the challenges brought by the drought that has affected the country., said the South African Local Government Association (Salga) National Executive Committee on Monday. “The recent events, such as the severe drought crisis following low rainfalls and now severe storms, are all confirmation of the threat posed by climate change. The scale of the threat posed by climate change and the impact that it has on the lives of our communities can no longer be taken for granted,” said Parks Tau, the former Johannesburg mayor and current Salga President. Tau was providing his political overview at the start of the Salga NEC meeting. Tau said local government leaders should give more thought to fighting climate change. “The City of Cape Town and the broader provinces of the Western Cape, the Eastern and Northern Capes are directly affected by the impact of climate change. The current drought crises in these provinces, should serve as a warning about managing water responsibly,” Tau said. The meeting also included representatives from the eThekwini Municipality, Cape Town and Nelson Mandela Bay who made presentations on how they were dealing with the water crisis. Daily News
