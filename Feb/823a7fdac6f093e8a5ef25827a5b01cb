Durban - The Pietermaritzburg High Court handed a 22 year sentence to cop killer Hlakaniphani Miya. In a statement released by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks), it said Miya, 33, was convicted for the murder of 38-year-old Constable Sithembiso Sifiso Yende. Hawks spokesman, Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said in 2014 Yende had reacted to cries from neighbours after they were attacked by armed robbers. “While proceeding he was confronted by the three gun-toting robbers who were shooting indiscriminately. In self-defence he shot  one of the suspects, later identified as Miya but was overwhelmed by the suspects,” he said. The other suspects were Nkosiyakhe Mabaso, 33 and Thando Mabaso, 31. The suspects took Yende’s firearm as they made their escape. The Hawks took over the investigation and the suspects handed themselves to the investigation team Mhlongo said. The three accused were formally charged and appeared in court, they were released on bail he said. While out on bail Nkosiyakhe Mabaso and Thando Mabaso were killed by rival taxi organisation in the Ezakheni area. Miya was also sentenced to 10 years for carrying an unlicensed firearm and five years for kidnapping of Yende’s neighbours Mhlongo said. He add that the sentences would be running concurrently. Lieutenant-General Yolisa Matakata, acting head of the Hawks said although the sentence would never bring Yende back,  or take away the pain his family was feeling, it would ensure that his killer would pay for their crimes.
