Ken Tweddell, Gold Circle’s events marketing manager, who comes up with the theme every year - and writes a special poem to go with it - was tight-lipped on Wednesday. Designers, fashionistas and hospitality venue organisers are all influenced by the theme, creating special outfits and decorating marquees at Greyville racecourse with their interpretations of it. “Yes, it’s a mystery at the moment,” grinned Tweddell, who has been inundated with requests from people eager to learn this year’s theme. “It started last year and just never stops. People ring me up and whenever they see me out and about, they ask what the theme is,” he said. Tweddell came up with theme in November but all he would say was it was “different, but great". He said a teaser campaign was being mounted to add to the excitement, with the theme being revealed on February 15 - the day after Valentine’s Day. Was that a clue? “No, no, not at all,” he laughed.
