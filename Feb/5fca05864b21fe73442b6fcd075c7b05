Durban - A 24-year-old man made his first court appearance after he was found with drugs in his possession. Gerald Perumal was nabbed outside a petrol station on Higginson Highway on Monday. He appeared in court on Tuesday. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, police spokesperson, said police searched Perumal’s vehicle and found about 2 400 heroin capsules inside the car. “He was immediately arrested and charged. He has appeared in the Wentworth Magistrates Court,” Zwane said. Meanwhile, police sting operations across the city have netted in almost R500 000 worth of drugs in three days. So far at least six people have appeared in court following multi-disciplinary raids in Phoenix, Chatsworth and Wentworth. Major General Bheki Langa, KZN SAPS Acting Provincial Commissioner, has lauded the efforts of officers. “The team has proven that we are committed in cleaning our streets off from the drug lords. We also appreciate the information we received from the community about people who are dealing in drugs,” he said. Daily News
