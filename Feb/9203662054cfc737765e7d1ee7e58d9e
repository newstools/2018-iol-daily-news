Durban - One of seven Glebelands murder accused abandoned his bail application on Tuesday in the Durban Regional Court. Mondli Mthethwa appeared briefly with Sergeant Bhekukwazi Mdweshu, Vukani Mcobothi, Khayelihle Mbuthuma, Wonderboy Mhlope, Matlala Mdweshu Ntshangase and Mahliphiza Mkhize. All seven were expected to apply for bail, but the matter was adjourned until March 26 with only Mthethwa abandoning his bail application. There was heavy police presence in court again yesterday as friends and family of the men filled the courtroom. The seven are accused of murder and attempted murder. About 100 people have died at the Glebelands Hostel in uMlazi that has been riddled with violence and led to a satellite police station being established near the hostel. Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela compiled a report that found the eThekwini Municipality and Department of Social Development had failed the people of the hostel by letting the violence escalate. Madonsela said the municipality had failed to assist the victims of violence and those evicted from the hostel. This was one of a series of findings she made in her report entitled “Stop the carnage”, which was released in 2016. Daily News
