Durban - A man from Mount Edgecombe who was arrested for faking the hijacking of his Jaguar has appeared in court and been granted bail. Sachin Ramesh Gareeb (37) was arrested and charged for perjury. He appeared in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court this week, where the case was adjourned to March 13, said police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele. Mbhele said Gareeb had allegedly planned his fake hijacking at a meeting held at Springfield Park on January 23. “On 26 January 2018 at about 11:00, the suspect reported that he was hijacked of his silver Jaguar near Mount Moriah by two African males at gunpoint. On the same day, the vehicle was recovered in Chesterville area and suspects were arrested. A thorough police investigation revealed that the ‘hijacking victim’ had planned the hijacking in order to defraud the insurance by claiming for a hijacked vehicle. A case of defeating the ends of justice was immediately opened against him and he was charged,” said Mbhele. Daily News
