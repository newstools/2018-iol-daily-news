Whirlpool Corporation plant director at Isithebe Industrial Estate Trevor Graham said this week that the twin tub washer local production would enable them to offer a great value, high-quality product with short lead times into the Southern African market. “This line cost R4.3m to install and has a capacity of 24 units per hour. “It employs 25 people on a single shift and we plan to double-shift the line by end of 2018,” said Graham. Whirlpool said it employed 950 people directly in full season as well as 300 people in the Isithebe area, who work for suppliers that supply it. Graham said that since 2014 Whirlpool had invested R100m in plant and infrastructure in the refrigeration lines. “The installation of the washing machine line is our first stage of expansion from refrigerator only to a complete white goods local production,” Graham said. He said Whirlpool continued to be committed to Isithebe, the Ilembe district 
and KwaZulu-Natal. “Apart from the Twin Tub washer project we are also launching new refrigerator models which will be launched in March 2018,” said Graham. The KZN department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs said investments being poured into different parts of the province by big conglomerates were a major vote of confidence in the stability of KZN.
