Durban - A battle for the tombstone of one the generals who were involved in the battle of Isandlawana has resulted in KwaZulu-Natal’s legislature intervening in the matter. Inkosi Ntshingwayo KaMahole Khoza was the second in command to Zulu King Cetshwayo kaMpande during the battle of Isandlwana against British regiments in 1879. The dispute is between the Khoza clans who live in Eshowe and uLundi. One side of the family from uLundi has a family tree in support of their claim while the other family is from Eshowe where Khoza’s tombstone lies. The Public Participation Portfolio committee decided to intervene after receiving a petition from uLundi resident Zwelabo Khoza. Last month, the Public Participation Portfolio Committee resolved that there should be a meeting convened between the two parties and that the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) should also be invited to the meeting. It is expected that Cogta will make representations at the meeting. The dispute will be heard at the uMhlathuze Council Chamber in Richards Bay on Tuesday. Daily News
