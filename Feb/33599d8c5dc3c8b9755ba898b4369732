This comes after his son, 
Khaya Zondo, made his debut last weekend in the six-match, one-day international series against India. “I was very excited, but of course I would have been more excited if the team had won or performed much better than they did,” said the deputy chief justice. The Proteas were thumped by nine wickets by India, with Khaya being joint top scorer with JP Duminy with 25 runs each. Zondo said before the game he advised his son to relax and enjoy himself. He said Khaya starting showing a knack for cricket when he was in Grade 9. The 27-year-old middle order batsman is a product of the-then Bakers Mini Cricket programme which has produced the likes of AB de Villiers and Makhaya Ntini, among others. Zondo said Khaya always had natural leadership qualities. As a youngster, Khaya was introduced to the game by his mother, Sithembile Zondo, a mini-cricket coach. “He was captain of the first cricket team at Westville Boys’ High when he was in matric and I think there were older boys in the team,” the Constitutional Court judge said. “He is captain of the Dolphins and he enjoys the respect of the older players,” Zondo said. Khaya has been the captain of the Dolphins since last year. “My prediction is that the Proteas will make a comeback and win the next game,” said Zondo of today’s game, which is 
being played at the Newlands cricket ground in Cape Town. Daily News
