Durban - Two people were killed when the vehicle that they were travelling in crashed into a pole on the M4, northern freeway, before bursting into flames on Sunday night. Garrith Jamieson, Rescue Care Operations Director, said the incident occurred at the Glenashley offramp around 11pm. “Both occupants burnt to death in the vehicle after being entrapped in the wreckage,” he said. Meanwhile, a man was killed in Westville and two others injured when a bakkie rolled over on the N3, near the Pavilion turnoff on Monday morning. Russel Meiring, ER24 spokesperson, said when emergency teams arrived at the scene, they found that one man had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. “Unfortunately, nothing could be done for the man and he was declared dead. A second patient had to be extricated from the vehicle and a third was found outside the vehicle. Both patients were treated for their injuries and were thereafter transported to nearby hospitals for further treatment,” Meiring said. Police are investigating further. Daily News
