Durban - Eskom donated and opened new laundry and kitchen facilities at the Pietermaritzburg Mental Health Society as part of its corporate social investment programme on Tuesday. Joyce Zingoni, Eskom Communications and Stakeholder Manager in KZN said the Health Society which was in need of electrical installation, kitchen cupboards and laundry facilities, had applied to Eskom Development Foundation (ESDEF) for help. “ESDEF evaluated the application and came to their rescue by granting a donation of R54 640.00 to cover the costs of such installations,” said Zingoni. Zingoni said that as part of the psycho-social rehabilitation programme, the electrical installations were for the washing machines and stoves. Through these, adults living with disabilities who come to the centre will be able to acquire basic cooking and laundry skills which will make them independent. Lee Mchunu, Industry Support Manager said Eskom was not only there to give electricity to people but had the livelihood of communities at the centre of its operations. “Eskom is proud to be able to contribute to the development and upliftment of all citizens, and this small gesture is to demonstrate just that,” said Mchunu (speaking on behalf of Monde Bala, KZN General Manager). Phillipa Manning, the Centre Manager could not thank Eskom enough for the donation. “These facilities will go a long way in upskilling our people. It is heartening to know that there are organisations that care,” said Manning. The Mental Health Society is a registered non-profit organisation which caters for 1 093 mentally handicapped people. It offers services to adults with mental disabilities (counselling and support service; on-site residential care on a 24 hour basis day care and psycho-social rehabilitation in three protective workshops over 5 days).
