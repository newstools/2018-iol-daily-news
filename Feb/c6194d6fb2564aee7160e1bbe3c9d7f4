Police have advised those attending to avoid traffic violation tickets or becoming crime statistics. Parking is available at The Oval, the SABC Parking and Centrum Parking opposite the Workshop. There will be lane closures outside the stadium to allow for pedestrian safety and drop-offs and pick-ups. Masabalala Yengwa Avenue between Kingsmead Way and K.E.Masinga Road will also be closed. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, police spokesperson, said there would be adequate police officers deployed in and around the cricket stadium. Mbhele advised fans to leave valuable items at home or secure them in the boot of their cars. She warned motorists not to leave valuable items visible on car seats and to ensure their cars were locked before walking away. Motorists, she said, should beware of remote jamming syndicates. “Attendees are expected to take extra precautions and be responsible during and after the event,” Mbhele said. Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, Metro Police spokesperson, said the city was expecting 17 500 fans to flock to the stadium. The gates will open at 11am tomorrow and the match begins at 1pm. He warned fans not to drive if they have too much to drink and suggested having a sober driver to assist or hiring a taxi. Parboo also advised that car guards often remove traffic fines left on windscreens with unsuspecting motorists receiving a summons in the post months later. “Police will be on full alert for motorists driving under the influence of alcohol. Do not park your vehicle on verges, sidewalks, on yellow and red road markings. Your car could be fined and or towed away if it is obstructing traffic or damaging municipal property,” Parboo said.
