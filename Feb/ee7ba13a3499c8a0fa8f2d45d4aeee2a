Durban - Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane should focus on the problems affecting the Western Cape and not on the South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu), said Nomarashiya Caluza, the union's KwaZulu-Natal provincial secretary, said on Tuesday. This comes as the DA leader said the union had a role in the failure of the education system during the debate of the State of the Nation Address on Monday. “Minister Angie Motshekga’s Ministerial Task Team found that six out of nine provincial education departments have been captured by Sadtu bosses. Education is failing in these provinces because of Sadtu’s toxic influence,” Maimane said. He urged President Cyril Ramaphosa to end “State Capture” by the union. Speaking at the Sadtu KZN conference on Tuesday morning, at Sadtu House in Durban, Caluza said they would not spend much time and energy giving attention to Maimane. “It is political grandstanding because we know that he was trying to launch their election campaign (for the 2019 general election). Now that they have nothing on the table to base their election campaign on, as usual they have to target Sadtu. It is not the first time and is something we are used to. When we are approaching elections we will have opposition targeting Sadtu for one reason - the principles this organisation stands for,” Caluza said.
