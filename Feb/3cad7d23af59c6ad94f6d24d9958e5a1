Durban - The man accused of kidnapping and murdering Durban North woman, Siam Lee, has requested that he be sent to a prison in Pietermaritzburg and not Westville prison pending the furtherance of the investigation. The 29-year-old Assagay resident made his third appearance in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Friday. Last week, the biochemist requested that he be sent to Westville Prison and not the Durban North police station holding cells. He claimed that his family was being verbally abused when they came to visit him and that he feared for his life. However, Magistrate Mohamed Motala ruled that the accused be sent back to Durban North SAPS holding cells as it was easier for the investigating team to carry out their duties. The accused’s newly elected legal representation led by Advocate Brad Osborne, made known his client’s request but Motala explained that an application should be made to the Department of Correctional Services instead. As the accused walked up to the dock, he turned around and blew kisses to his family, who sat one row behind Lee’s mother, Carmen Nan Lee and #JusticeForSiamLee supporters. Dressed in a navy blue checked pants, a blue formal shirt and blue jacket, the accused often shook his head when Surekha Marimuthu, state prosecutor, read out the additional charges expected to be added to the charge sheet. Marimuthu said charges include rape, kidnap, robbery with aggravating circumstances, the pointing of a firearm, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm and intimidation. He is expected to make his formal bail application in early March. Lee, 20, was abducted in January. Her charred remains were found days later in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. Daily News
