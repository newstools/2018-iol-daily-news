Durban - Brayden Chase Daw, the 17-month-old baby who was rescued from a burning home in Escombe, in Durban, late last month, died in hospital on Monday night after a brave fight. His mother, Samantha Chane Weideman, said Brayden had sustained first- and second-degree burns over 60% of his body and had picked up a chest infection on Sunday. His condition worsened on Monday afternoon and he died at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital, where he had been receiving treatment since the fire on Saturday, since January 27. Brayden was Weideman's and husband Nicholas Thomas Daw’s only child. They were too distraught to speak on Tuesday morning.

Weideman climbed out of the bathroom window, clinging to a pipe. She then tried to grab Brayden from the sink where she had left him, but she fell to the ground when the pipe gave way from the wall. Brayden was trapped in the bathroom and was drawing his last breath when Queensburgh fireman Charles Zikhali broke off a burglar gate and rushed in to rescue him. Eric Wolfaardt, Queensburgh Fire Department acting station commander, said the news of Brayden’s death was devastating. Wolfaardt and his crew resuscitated Brayden outside the house after conducting CPR for 30 minutes. Messages of condolence were posted on the Hero Burn Foundation’s Facebook page, along with messages of support for the bereaved parents.
