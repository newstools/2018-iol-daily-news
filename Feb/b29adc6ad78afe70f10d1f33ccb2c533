Durban - Chippy the Jack Russel was reunited with his owner after going missing three years ago from his home in Edenvale in Johannesburg. Chippy ended off at the Durban and Coast SPCA as a stray dog. Bronwyn Kuhlenthal, who has adopted Chippy from her stepdad Graham Moore explained that the dog managed to get through the gate at home during a fireworks display in the area. Moore was upset and tried his best to find Chippy who was five years old at the time. He had also micro chipped the dog in the event that if it gets lost it could easily be traced back to its owners. Moore then relocated to Paulshof, a disheartened pet owner. Tanya Fleischer, SPCA Durban and Coast spokesperson, said when dogs are reunited with their families it brings so much joy to them. Fleischer said Chippy arrived at the SPCA as a stray but because he is micro chipped they were able to contact his owners immediately. "We were elated when the SPCA contacted us. Moore had a Scottish Terrier puppy and he is only allowed one pet in the complex where he lives. So I adopted Chippy. Upon his arrival, he danced around Moore and would not leave his side. It was an emotional day," said Kuhlenthal who lives in Midrand. Moore visits regularly to meet Chippy but the question in the families mind is how did Chippy get to Durban? "All animals adopted from the SPCA are micro chipped before they go to their forever home. Micro chipping is a painless procedure for the animal. Keep an eye out for our micro chipping days where you can bring in your pets to be micro chipped at a discounted price," Fleischer explained. Daily News
