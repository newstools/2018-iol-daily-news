Durban - A woman was arrested in Verulam, north of Durban, for the theft of 65 Kit Kat chocolates and a school bag from a store on Tuesday. Private security company Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) was called to the scene of the incident. Rusa spokesperson Prem Balram said the woman was in possession of a pink school bag with the chocolates in it when they arrived at the business premises. “During an interview the Ndwedwe resident confirmed that she had removed two boxes of the chocolates from a shelf near the entrance of the store and proceeded to a quieter aisle where she loaded the chocolates into a school bag which she had also stolen,” he said. Balram said one of the staff caught her as she was leaving. The woman told Rusa officers that she stole the chocolates, which are sold for R10 at the store, and would sell them at the Verulam taxi rank for half the price. Balram said the woman is believed to be part of a shoplifting syndicate and had been arrested for chocolate theft several times by Rusa officers. He continued that the woman is a habitual criminal and not deterred by previous arrests and detention. Verulam police said they had no knowledge of the incident. Daily News
