Durban - A group of about 100 graduate teachers marched through the streets of Durban on Monday demanding work opportunities. The  march was characterised by them singing  "What have we done? Our only sin was to get educated" The marchers made their way to Durban's city hall where they planned to hand over a memorandum of demands to the department of education. One of the graduate teachers is Ngilo Ndlovu, 32, who studied Maths and Science at University of Zululand. She said she had been looking for work since 2016. "I have been looking for work and nothing is appearing," Ndlovu said. The Chatsworth resident said the only reason that is preventing her from giving up are her parents whose support she relies on.

She said she went to numerous schools looking for teaching positions but is always turned away. She said some principals said they wish they could hire her but they no longer had the power to do this anymore.
 
"When I was going to study I told my children that they must be patient with me for four years while I study as life was going to get better for us. But after I finished studying and not finding job they are now asking me when I will start working as I promised them," Ndlovu said. She said other teachers have given up and have become outcasts in their families. Daily News Ndlovu said she hoped the march would send a clear message to the department of education to employ them.
