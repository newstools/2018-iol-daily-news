DCCI chief executive Dumile Cele said this was evident through the support and sponsorships received by various businesses for their networking and social events. “Furthermore, retail trade sales increased by 8.2% year-on-year in November 2017,” said Cele. The DCCI said one highlight was when their members showed support for the launch of the first Durban business code of ethics”. “While our members might have a code of ethics in their respective companies, the Durban chamber has raised the flag of ethical leadership at a collective level among our members.” Last year the Durban chamber partnered World Chambers Congress 2017 held in Sydney, taking along a group of small, medium and micro enterprises, giving them the opportunity to gain global market exposure. The chamber said setbacks last year included the October storms, which wreaked havoc in Durban and damaged the south of the city. Cele said businesses in Durban reported extensive damage to property and loss of productivity. “Valuable assets that contribute to the day-to-day operations of businesses were put at risk, to the extent of some losing their assets.” Cele said the DCCI was optimistic about this year, and looked forward to some of its big business events. “These events for 2018 include its annual gala dinner, which is hosted every year. The event is regarded as a highlight on the Durban business calendar,” said Cele. “The partnership between the Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Transnet Port Terminals continues to grow as we will again host the KZN Exporter of the Year Awards. The awards have grown since their inception in 2000. The aim of these awards is to recognise and celebrate exporters in the province, while we stimulate the growth of our economy. Furthermore, the golf day is recognised as one of the Durban chamber’s signature events. This year we aim to re-create this event with the same purpose, but a different narrative.” Daily News
