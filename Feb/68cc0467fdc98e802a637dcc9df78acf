Former uMlazi police cluster commander, Major-General Dumezweni Chiliza, led a high-level delegation from the SAPS to the Moerane commission which is probing the underlying causes of the murder of politicians in the province. “We can’t say what’s going on at Glebelands is political, it’s more of criminality. It’s a territorial fight between two groups,” Chiliza said. He said clashes began after some ANC members who had defected to Cope after the 2009 general elections and rejoined the ANC accused the ward councillor of giving jobs at a development at the hostel to his friends. The group staged marches against the councillor and ran a parallel structure (Mthembu group). Chiliza said violence escalated in 2014 when a second group emerged (Hlophe) and a feud ensued. Groups Chiliza told commissioners that the warring groups had self-appointed leaders who would not let go of power unless the eThekwini Municipality came up with a policy to regulate the hostel. “Before the emergence of the Hlophe group, crime was decreasing: 24 murders were committed between 2010 and 2014. But in the 2014 to 2015 financial year alone, 18 murders were committed, and 17 murders took place in 2016,” he 
said. Chiliza admitted when probed further by evidence leader Mthokozisi Ngcobo that failure to stop the phenomenon of selling bed spaces and unlawful evictions led to it becoming a lucrative business, and to more violence. “There was unwillingness from the residents to come forward with information because they fear being killed,” added Chiliza. He said this trend also eroded trust between the police and the community. “One can deploy a thousand policemen at Glebelands but the killings will continue due to factors such as the design of the hostel. There are dark passages even during the day - that is a recipe for disaster,” Chiliza concluded. Daily News
