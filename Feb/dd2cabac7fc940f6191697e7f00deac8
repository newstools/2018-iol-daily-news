Durban - A Durban-based car repair company is counting the costs after a fire damaged five vehicles parked alongside the premises in the early hours of Monday morning. Emergency teams rushed to a fire at a building off Florence Nzama (Prince Alfred) Street to find cars well alight. The owner of the repair workshop, who asked not to be named, said he rushed to his business after receiving a call about the fire. The man said he believed the fire was started by someone trying to steal a radio from one of the cars. “From what we saw and where we believe the fire started, someone must have been trying to steal a car radio from one of the cars. They probably broke the wires, causing it to short circuit. The wire could have continued burning and eventually a fire was started. Four of the cars that were parked close to that car, an Audi, were extensively damaged. The front section of a fifth car, parked a distance away from the Audi, was damaged,” the owner said. No injuries were reported. Last month at least 15 vehicles were burnt in a fire at a business premises in Stalwart Simelane (Stanger) Street.  Hours later, teams rushed to the second fire in Khuzimpi Shezi  (Williams) Road in uMbilo. At both scenes, no injuries were reported. Daily News
