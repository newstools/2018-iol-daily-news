Durban - Police swooped on a gang of four robbers in Westville on Friday after being alerted to the robbery by a home security panic button that the bandits accidentally pressed. Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said the gang had inadvertently pressed the resident’s panic alarm when trying to open the garage door, alerting a patrolling Blue Security armed response officer to the attack in Kinley Road at around 8.30am. “The suspects attacked the resident and her 11 year old son in their home, holding them up at gunpoint before loading cellphones, cash and other valuables into the resident’s vehicle. They then tried to open the garage door manually but within a minute our officer arrived at the scene. The suspects turned and fled on foot, two of them jumping into a taxi to evade arrest, while the others fled into a nearby bushy area,” Mathios said. “The police responded to the incident and chased down the taxi into Roger Sishi Road where they arrested two of the suspects. The SAPS Shongweni K9 Unit tracked down a further two suspects in the bush and arrested them. One suspect remains at large,” Mathios said. Mathios said the boy had sustained a minor injury to his shoulder and was receiving assitance from crisis care volunteers,. Mathios said the arrests were the result of excellent team work between Blue Security, Westville SAPS, the SAPS Shongweni K9 Unit, the Durban Flying Squad, Metro Police and Jag Security Daily News
