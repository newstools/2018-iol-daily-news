Durban - As the Daily News celebrates its 140th birthday this year, an avid reader has stumbled on a copy of the newspaper from 1938.
Victor Naidu, 67, has tried to keep the newspaper from July 2, 1938, in good condition by taping it up in places where it has begun to tear. Naidu’s father, Willie, gave him a framed photograph of Mahatma Gandhi, but the glass broke. When Naidu removed the glass, he found the newspaper along with the original Gandhi title deed for a property he sold in the 1800s. “It has the July Handicap in it. It also has car sales adverts. Cars were selling for R2 500.” Naidu said he needed someone to look after the paper and put it together.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

Rachel said they had collected coins, notes, spoons, plates and holy books over the years, but they were all left in Johannesburg when they moved to Durban more than a year ago to spend their retirement by the beach.
