Durban - Section 21 schools who have not paid electricity will not be disconnected, Mayor Zandile Gumede said. Speaking at a full council meeting on Wednesday where the Mid-Year Budget and Performance Assessment Report was tabled, Gumede said the non profit schools owed the city total of R80 365 730. Gumede said that the report proposed that disconnection notices should be sent to the schools and disconnection will be executed at the schools. However, a decision was taken to send the notice but not disconnect electricity. “There is no way the Municipality is saying schools will be disconnected. I reiterate what I said yesterday (on Tuesday at Exco) that while we won’t stand in the way of officials doing their work they must send notices so we can see in reports what the situation is. Those schools who receive the disconnection notices are welcome to come the Municipality to make payment arrangements. You have to pay for services rendered, it is very important,” Gumede said. Gumede said that as the mayor, she will not allow schools in poor communities to have their electricity disconnected. “They must come to us and make payment arrangements so that we can continue to provide services. If anyone alleges electricity has been disconnected at a school let us know in writing so we can investigate. We will always liaise with principals,” Gumede continued. Mondli Mthembu, Chairperson of the Human Settlements and Infrastructure Committee welcomed the report and reiterated what the mayor had said. “Mayor Gumede did not say electricity must be disconnected at schools. She said notices of disconnection must be sent as processes have to be followed,” Mthembu said. Daily News
