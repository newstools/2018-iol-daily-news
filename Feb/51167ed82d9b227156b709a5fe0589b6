 Rest now dear soul. pic.twitter.com/4r101ZYd0T — Portia Gumede (@portiagumedesa) February 14, 2018  I pray that your next president may give you all that your former president couldn’t! I hope you don’t regret celebrating today. I hope you don’t feel the way some Angolans are feeling about our new president 😫.
