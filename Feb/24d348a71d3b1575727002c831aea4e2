Durban - Police have closed in on a suspected housebreaking syndicate following the arrests of two men minutes after a house robbery in Bayview on Wednesday night. While two men have since been arrested, police are confident they will find their accomplices. Already, the gang has been linked to a spate of incidents in Sydenham, Berea, uMbilo, Durban North and Wentworth. The men were arrested following a shootout with police in Lamontville on Wednesday night. It is alleged that the two men, along with two others, had committed a house robbery in Bayview, Chatsworth. Captain Nqobile Gwala, police spokesperson, said police responded to an alert about the robbery and when they spotted the gang’s white Mercedes Benz, members of the gang fired shots at police. “Police retaliated, injuring one suspect, another suspect was tackled by a canine and the two fled on foot. None of the police officers were injured,” she said. Gwala said the injured men were taken to the police station under police guard. Investigations revealed that the vehicle used by the gang, was hijacked at uMbilo last week and one of the recovered firearms was taken during the house robbery in Durban North. “Suspects will be charged for possession of unlicensed firearms, possession of stolen property and attempted murder,” Gwala said. Police also recovered firearms from the men. The arrests have been hailed by Major General Bheki Langa, KZN Acting Provincial Commissioner. “We are happy that police officers escaped the shooting unscathed. Suspects will be profiled to ascertain if they can be linked to other serious and violent crimes in Durban and surroundings,” he said. Daily News
