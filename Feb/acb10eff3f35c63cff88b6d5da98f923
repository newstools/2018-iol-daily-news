A report containing the policy that outlines the use of municipal vehicles by councillors when performing official duties was tabled at the city’s Executive Committee (Exco) meeting at the city hall on Tuesday. The policy was drafted in consultation with the city’s legal and compliance unit, the speaker’s office and the city’s fleet unit. DA provincial leader Zwakele Mncwango said they had noted that some councillors used council vehicles to attend political gatherings “outside” the municipal jurisdiction. “It becomes a concern even when metro police vehicles are used during these events. We’re getting allowances so I don’t understand why we are pushing for this policy. Some councillors are not even trained in advanced driving so you need to take this policy back and revise it,” Mncwango said. His colleague, Heinz de Boer, said the policy was not well written. “The policy is too loose as it doesn’t exclude certain vehicles such as metro police vehicles or fire engines. I understand that there are times where officials would need to go on oversight visits. As it stands, the policy is loosely worded. It’s not clear what happens if someone runs a pedestrian over and how the driver would be held to account,” De Boer said. Mayor Zandile Gumede proposed that the policy be taken to Full Council, suggesting that if challenges existed, it could be reviewed annually. The ANC and IFP approved the policy, while the DA opposed it. Daily News
