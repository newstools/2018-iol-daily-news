Durban - Efforts to increase police visibility in the uMbilo precinct yielded positive results when two men were caught trying to steal a vehicle outside King Edward VIII Hospital on Tuesday morning. Lieutenant Colonel Stanley Perumal, uMbilo SAPS Visible Policing Commander said, they were conducting an operation in the early parts of the morning when they noticed two men busy near a white Toyota Corolla parked at the side of the road. “We were conducting a stop and search and saw the two men. A third was seated inside a Gold VW Polo, also parked at the side of the road. When the two men saw us, they left the Corolla and ran towards the Polo. Our officers managed to catch the two men,” Perumal said. The third man, in the Polo, drove off. The two men were arrested and taken to the station. Perumal said they were charged. The men are set to appear in court soon. Perumal said this is part of their plan to root out crime from their precinct. He added that a number of operations have been planned in the area. Two weeks ago, twelve suspected prostitutes were arrested during a planned raid in uMbilo. “We searched properties in Shrewsberry Avenue, Campbell Road and Clark Grove. We did not make any arrests at the first property by at the second and third properties, we arrested a total of 12 women for prostitution and six men for not having their necessary citizenship documentation with them. We also recovered knives, alcohol, dagga, cellphones and other items used during the consumption of drugs. These included glass tubes,” he said. Daily News
