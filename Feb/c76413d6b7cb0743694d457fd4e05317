Ben Madokwe, chairperson of the Active Citizens’ Movement, said they welcomed the move by the ANC and the opposition parties. Madokwe said they were now hoping for the incoming president, Cyril Ramaphosa, to deal with the cabinet ministers who were inefficient and replace them with credible leaders who would take the country forward. “South Africans knew that the country was moving in the wrong direction in terms of the economy and the corruption in government, the state captures and the chaos in the looting of parastatal companies such as Eskom,” he said. Madokwe said what was happening now, and the motion of no-confidence against Zuma, was long-overdue action to save the country. “This should have happened two years ago. The move by the opposition parties and the leadership of the ANC should be applauded. We believe that in the interests of the country, Ramaphosa will have to appoint credible cabinet ministers.” Verushka Nendutt, of the Market Users’ Committee, said what the country needed to recover on all levels was to have a new breed of leaders who put people first and were not corrupt. “We are looking forward to having a president who will make the right decisions. With Zuma stepping down, we believe it will send out a strong message to other politicians,” she said. Thabo Maile, the provincial co-ordinator of Right to Know, said they had no sympathy for Zuma being recalled by his own party leaders. He said many things had been delayed under Zuma’s leadership including the Protection of Information Bill. “The reason why we have the Right to Know organisation today is because were were not happy with certain sections of the bill, which is still sitting on Zuma’s desk and has been since 2014. We have no sympathy for the harsh way in which he is going to leave his position. His exit is long overdue,” he said. Daily News
