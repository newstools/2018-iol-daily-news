Durban - South Africans of all hues and political persuasions are embracing the presidency of Cyril Ramaphosa but if a recent Daily News Facebook poll is anything to go by, the newly minted president may not have it all his way at next year's general election. A Daily New Facebook poll asked readers who they would prefer between Ramaphosa and the leader of the official opposition, Mmusi Maimane if the election was to be held the next day. Despite the renewed confidence by many people on the election of Ramaphosa and the surge of the Rand in the wake of his ascendancy to the top job, the majority of those who participated in the poll said they preferred Maimane. Of the 209 people who 'voted', 103 (62 per cent) said they would vote for Maimane whole 79, (38 per cent) preferred Ramaphosa.    Here is what some of the followers said about the poll: Zaki Zak Hampton: “None” Alice Simon: “Both.” Andries J Els: “None of them ! We need leaders that are selected by their intelligence and ability to lead not by angry masses threatening to destroy the country” Lynda Jane: “neither” Mark Busby: “Cyril, I think... It depends on whether Zuma gets prosecuted though. Mmusi has become power-hungry... If we don't vote ANC, we give Malema more chance…” Daily News
