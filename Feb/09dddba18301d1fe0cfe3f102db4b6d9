Rally Reddy said he suspected his dogs were poisoned on Friday night after he had an electrical problem and the house was in darkness. His two dogs, Dolce and Gabbana,  slept in the house at night and at 2am they had started vomiting and had diarrhoea. “I cleaned up after them and went back to bed. At 5am they did the same thing. I told my daughter to take them to the vet for a check-up,” Reddy said. While Reddy was busy in his backyard, he found little pieces of meat on the grass but was not aware they were poisoned. After receiving treatment at a veterinary clinic, Reddy had to transfer the dogs to a clinic in Sherwood where they stayed overnight for observation. “They are part of the family, so it was quite strenuous. I think they vomited most of the poison out, but the toxins still got to them,” Reddy said. Brenda Neal, Montclair Crime Eye founder, said this was the second incident of dog poisoning in a week. A vehicle was broken into on Wood Road. The owner’s dog was suspected of being poisoned. “This is the work of criminals. Keep an after-hours vet number,” Neal advised. According to veterinarians, the signs of poisoning are vomiting; diarrhoea; seizures; blood in the stool; lethargy; loss of appetite; nosebleed; drooling; laboured breathing; loss of consciousness; conscious but non-responsive and organ failure.
