But this year, they wound everyone up - and maybe ticked them off - by putting out a couple of teasers first. “People would come to me and ask, ‘is it this?’ or ‘is it that?’, and all I said was that I would tell them in time,” said Ken Tweddell, Gold Circle’s events marketing manager, who pens the Vodacom Durban poem every year. And when the big moment came and the months of suspense and speculation ended and the theme - “It is time” - was finally announced, “everyone liked it”, said Tweddell on Tuesday. Durban fashion designer Haroun Hansrot said he thought it was a “superb” theme. Designers are inspired by the theme to create outfits for the big race at Greyville, and interior designers do the same for the hospitality venues. Tweddell says in the poem every element of the race day has an aspect of time attached to it. And, of course, one of the biggest aspects - fashion - is itself timeless, which could also mean going back to a long-ago era in fashion. One verse suggests people “explore a watch face” whether it was understated, classic or detailed. “Women have diamanté watches and men generally have black-and-white watches,” he said, giving fashionistas clues about what to wear on July 7. And come the big day, everything will run like clockwork, and in time-honoured tradition, the most important race will start at precisely 4.20pm. Daily News
