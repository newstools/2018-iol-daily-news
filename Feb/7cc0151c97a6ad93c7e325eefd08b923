Durban - Provincial health MEC, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, will spend this week visiting schools in KwaMashu to encourage youngsters to live healthy lives. Dhlomo, fresh from the KwaMashu Park Run on Saturday, went on to compete in the 21km Pietermaritzburg Witness Marathon held on Sunday. Dhlomo ran the marathon for charity. Speaking of his upcoming visits, he said he wants to  encourage the youth to participate in the Rark Run in their own area. “We also see park runners in the white suburbs that are very well attended. We now have KwaMashu Park Run that is one year and a month old, and some citizens of KwaMashu don't know about it as yet,” he said. Dhlomo said residents should consider taking part in this 5km Park Run next Saturday as a way of exercising and promoting a long and healthy life. “People do not fall sick often if their bodies are used to exercising. I am part of these activities as a Health MEC who must make savings on the health budget and get our citizens to live longer. It starts by encouraging young people, hence my road show next week in KwaMashu,” he said. Daily News
