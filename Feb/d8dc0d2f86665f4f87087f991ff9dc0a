Durban - Three people have been arrested have been arrested following a raid at the Gupta compound in Saxonwold, Johannesburg, on Wednesday morning. This is according to Hawks National spokesperson, Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi. He was commenting after the raid. In a statement released by the Hawks, Mulaudzi said three more people are expected to hand themselves over. Mulaudzi said the operation is in respect of the Vrede Farm investigations. "Operations are still ongoing and further details will be made available at a later stage,” he said. They are believed to be looking for documents and other material linked to a multi-agency probe into allegations of state capture, particularly the multimillion-rand Estina dairy project that saw millions of rands meant for black emerging farmers funnelled to the Guptas. Those arrested on Wednesday were expected to appear in a Bloemfontein court on Thursday. Meanwhile, the raid has been welcomed  by opposition parties.  Democratic Alliance (DA) and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP)are united in their sentiments but they believe the “writing had been on the wall for some time”. The raid comes a day after the ruling party’s National Executive Committee recalled President Jacob Zuma. Daily News
