Durban - The leader of the Zimbabwe opposition political party Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Morgan Tsvangirai, is reported to be in a critical condition. According to Reuters, a party source who knows about his condition said that his supporters should “brace for the worst”. The opposition leader has been in and out of hospital since June 2016, after disclosing that he has colon cancer and has been in South Africa for treatment. “From the medical report that I received yesterday, the situation is not looking good. He is critically ill and we should brace for the worst,” the source said. Tsvangirai’s spokesperson, Luke Tamborinyoka, said the leader was “stable but the nation should keep on praying”. In January, Tsvangirai had said that older generations should step back and make way for “new hands”, which sparked the possibility of a new leader being elected for his party. In 1999 Tsvangirai had founded and became the leader of the MDC, becoming the opposition party to then president Robert Mugabe’s ZANU-PF. Daily News
