Durban - Sahara Stadium Kingsmead will host their first cricket match final in 16 years. The last final was played in the 2001-02 season when KwaZulu-Natal beat Western Province in the 50 over competition. The Hollywoodbets Dolphins will face the Warriors in the Momentum One-Day Cup final on Friday at 1.30pm. On Thursday the stadium hosted the first Momentum One Day International (ODI) match between South Africa and India, which India won by six wickets. Fans who attended the ODI on Thursday were given the opportunity of buying tickets for the final at a very low price of R20 and can sit anywhere during the final. With homeground advantage on their side, the Dolphins are hoping to be winners of the 2017/18 Momentum One-Day Cup as they play the team from the Eastern Cape. Coach Grant Morgan said all they want to do is keep improving as they have done in the RAM SLAM and have now done it again in the Momentum One Day Cup. “We want to give the fans in Durban something to be proud of and this is the second final in the city in six months after the Currie Cup final,” Morgan continued. “To play in front of a home crowd in a final is something that all the players are looking forward to,” Morgan said. The last time the Dolphins walked away with silverware was in the 2013/14 season when they won the Ram Slam T20 Challenge against the Cape Cobras at Newlands in Cape Town. A win will also give Morgan his first title since his appointment in October 2016. Daily News
