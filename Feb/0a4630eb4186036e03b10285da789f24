Durban - Atul Gupta has filed court papers challenging the decision to freeze R10 million in his personal bank account. eNCA reporter Karyn Maughan on Monday tweeted copies of the order which he seeks to set aside by March 1. In the Notice, Gupta confirms that he is out of the country and became aware of the matter in early February. "I have not been served with such an order and have only managed to glean the facts in relation to the order roughly from my attorneys. I deny that I have received R10m as alleged. However, not having had the opportunity to read the papers (which I am led to understand are voluminious)," the Notice reads. Gupta further states that the affidavit was prepared in haste and he will accordinly seek to supplement the affidavit once he has had the adequate opportunity to read, consider and discuss the matter with his legal team. It is believed that the monies were paid from the Estina Dairy Project.
