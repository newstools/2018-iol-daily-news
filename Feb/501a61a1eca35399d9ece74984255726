Durban - The two men accused of killing,decapitating Thembinkosi Nzimakwe and also selling his head to a tradition healer for muti, will go for mental observation. Philani Jojisa and Lehlahonalo Swartbooi are facing a charge of murder and contravening the Human Tissues Act. Jojisa was arrested after he was caught with Nzimakwe's head in his back pack, while in a process of selling it on August 4 at the Durban market. It is believed that a traditional healer had instructed the two men to behead Nzimakwe while still alive in order to make a powerful muti. When the pair appeared in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Wednesday the matter was adjourned until February 14 to allow for their mental observation. Magistrate Mahomed Motala ordered that Jojisa be sent for a 30-day mental observation and Swartbooi be taken for a preliminary mental observation in preparation for the trial. Nzimakwe, 33, originally of Ncenjani homestead in Bizana in the Eastern Cape, moved to Durban in 2015 and rented a room with his younger brother, Mvuyisi. He was missing for few days before his body was found dumped in the bushes in Cato Crest. Daily News
