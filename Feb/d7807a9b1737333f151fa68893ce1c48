Durban - A trap has been set in the hope to catch two crocodiles that were spotted in a river near an informal settlement in KwaDukuza on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast. Neville Wolmarans, owner of Ndlondlo Reptile Park near oThongati, said they were contacted by the police saying that the community had seen two crocodiles in the Etete River, under the bridge, near the R102. The Etete informal settlement is situated nearby. "Ndlondlo reptile park and the Ezemvelo KwaZulu Natal went out to investigate on Wednesday and last night. We could not spot them but from what we heard and descriptions given the crocodiles could be just above a metre in length,"Wolmarans said. Although the crocodiles posed no threat Wolmarans said that last night Ndlondlo accompanied Ezemvelo KZN to set up a trap near the river to capture them. "There are crocodiles in most of the rivers including the Umhlali and Umvoti River. They are in isolated areas and pose no threat to humans. Etete is quite an isolated area but because of the informal settlement we were concerned. If they are caught we will relocate them," Wolmarans said. Craig Watson, Crocodile Creek spokesperson, said he saw the crocodiles when he went out to the area on Wednesday. Watson said they were not under two metres in length and posed no threat to humans. "There is a massive reed bed with a nice water area which is conducive for them. They were having the times of their lives and enjoying it. I have seen the heads of them and they disappeared. Crocodiles can hold their breathe for hours underwater so if they are disturbed they submerge themselves. They will get into the trap if they are hungry," Watson said. May 2013, there was outrage after a 3 metre crocodile was shot dead by wildlife officials on the uMgeni River banks near Blue Lagoon in Durban. The crocodile evaded capture for four years. Wildlife officials said it was a preventing any of the canoeists from being attacked by the crocodile. Daily News
