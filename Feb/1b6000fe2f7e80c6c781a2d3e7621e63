Durban - The eThekwini Municipality recently made two announcements which will cost the city financially. In the wake of a spate of bridge rock-throwing incidents across the city, which also claimed the lives of two people, the city announced that they did not have the money to build cages over bridges, in a bid to curb these incidents. However, a week later, the city had approved R13 million at its executive committee meeting to erect two statues of struggle heroes, the late president Nelson Mandela and O.R. Tambo. Through a Facebook poll, the Daily News recently asked its Facebook followers which of the two, should the city prioritise and this is what they said: In a few days, the poll had reached over 100 000 people and received a total of 5 400 votes. Only 115 people voted for the erecting of the two statues while over 5 300 people voted for bridges to be caged. By Friday morning the poll also received over 324 shares, 160 reactions and 88 comments. Daily News
