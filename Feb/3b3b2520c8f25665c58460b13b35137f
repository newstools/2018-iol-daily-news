Cape Town - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has once again come under fire from parliament’s portfolio committee on justice and correctional services over her controversial public utterances. These include calls by Mkhwebane that terms of reference for the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture be broadened beyond the recommendations of the remedial action of her predecisor Thuli Madonsela, who investigated the allegations. The committee has now summoned Mkhwebane to come before them to explain her utterances and other allegations against her, including that her office was guilty of suppressing evidence in some investigations. Committee chairperson Mathole Motshekga said Mkhwebane’s comments were concerning, adding that the committee now wanted to know “what exactly she is trying to convey”. “This type of allegations only tarnishes the good image of the office of the Public Protector,” Motshekga said. The Office of the Public Protector was not available for comment by the time of publication. Motshekga said it was decided that Mkhwebane be called to appear before the committee on Wednesday this week. Political Bureau
