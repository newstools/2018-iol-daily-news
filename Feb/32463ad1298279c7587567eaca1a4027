Durban - Police are still at the scene where a security guard was shot dead after trying to apprehend robbers in the busy Madressa Arcade between Dr Yusuf Dadoo (Grey) Street and Cathedral Road. A source said that a group of robbers followed a businessman from the bank after he had withdrawn money. When the robbers grabbed hold of the businessman in the arcade bystanders screamed for help. A security guard based in the arcade responded and grabbed hold of one of the suspects. A scuffle ensued between the two as the robber tried to free himself from the guard's grip. The robber allegedly shot him in the chest. The guard died at the scene. The robbers fled abandoning the car they arrived in, a BMW. Police at the scene said the car was hijacked from Chatsworth. Garrith Jamieson, Rescue Care Paramedics spokesperson, said the guard was declared dead just after 12 pm. The incident follows Tuesday's shooting where a bullet grazed the head of a security guard during a robbery at a pizza outlet in Bertha Mkhize Road. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, police spokesperson, said a case of murder has been opened at the Durban Central police station. On Tuesday night, Zwane said a 42-year-old man and his girlfriend were watching television when two unidentified suspects forced the door open in Goswell Road. Zwane said the suspects shot the man in the chest and at gunpoint robbed them of cash before fleeing the crime scene on foot. No arrests or recoveries. The victim was rushed to a hospital for medical attention. Charges of house robbery and attempted murder are being investigated by Camperdown SAPS. Daily News
