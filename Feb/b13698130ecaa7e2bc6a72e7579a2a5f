Durban - A man who raped a 14-year-old girl in Msinsini near Port Shepstone in 2013 had the book thrown at him by the Scottburgh Regional Court who sent him to prison for life. In addition, Captain Nqobile Gwala, police spokesperson said Justice Gumbi will spend the rest of his life behind bars after the Scottburgh Regional Court handed him a life term in prison. “His name will be recorded in the National Register of Sex Offenders, will be unfit to possess a firearm and will never be able to work in an environment involving children,” said Gwala. “The accused went to the home of his 14-year-old victim where he beat her with an electrical cord, threatened her with a knife and fired a shot to further intimidate her. He stuffed her mouth with a towel preventing her from screaming out for help,” explained Gwala. She said during investigations, it was revealed that Gumbi was held in Durban on charges of armed robbery which took place in Verulam in 2015, but the charges were later withdrawn. “Unfortunately for him, he could not escape the penalties for the crime he committed against an innocent vulnerable child in Msinsini and had to stand trial for his dreadful deeds,” she said. The KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa is pleased with the outcome of a case. “This sentence shows that the detective team have been diligently working on the case,” he said.
