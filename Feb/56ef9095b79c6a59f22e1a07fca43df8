Durban - Staff at the eThekwini Municipality’s water works department were held hostage on Monday. One of the staff who was in the building said they had been locked in for the entire day at its Springfield offices. She said they initially did not pay attention to the strike during the day as they were busy working inside the building. It was only when it was time to leave for home that they realised they could not leave the building. “We are under hostage,” she said. The staff made various attempts to leave the building. Those who tried to leave the building were being forced back into it. Other staff tried calling for Uber cabs but were also forced to go back she said. Parboo Sewpersad, Metro Police spokesperson, said police officers were on the scene and fired rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. Tozi Mthethwa, eThekwini Municipality's spokesperson, said they were aware of the protest but were not in a position to give comment on the matter as it was between employer and employee. If there were issues they would address it be with the employees concerned, she said. This is the second strike that has affected the municipality this year. In January, the Daily News reported that Durban Solid Works employees who are under the government’s Expanded Public Works Programme demanded to be made permanent employees of the city. The striking workers turned the city into a dump as rubbish was strewn across the central business district. Daily News
