The community now has something to look at while they wait for treatment at the clinic, which opened in August. One of the three designers of the mural, Gifford Duminy, explained why they chose the design. “Plants are a symbol of healing, so using images of medicinal plants was our starting point.” The other artist, Sphephelo Mnguni, said the motto was 
to add colour to uplift the people. Duminy said they kept adding colour to brighten the mural and make it as happy and cheerful as possible. Mook Lion, the third artist, said they tried to transform the space using creativity. “We wanted the people to benefit the most.” The mural took three days to complete and Mnguni said they were pleased with it. Busi Shangase, a social worker at the clinic, said: “The patients love the wall.” Terri Clapperton, the corporate social responsibility and investment manager at Container World, said they were pleased with the result. The mural had now given people something positive to look 
at. Daily News
