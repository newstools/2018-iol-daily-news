Addressing the media in Durban on Thursday, Zikalala said he was part of the collective that took the decision. “We knew that president Zuma was leaving and it was an emotional period, but so be it. It didn’t mean the ANC was wrong. “We have to accept that decision as a decision of the ANC.” Zikalala said Zuma had not been found guilty of corruption charges and these charges would soon be put to the test. Rally He also urged party members to rally behind President Cyril Ramaphosa. He added that the ANC was not going to make it a norm that state presidents do not finish their terms of office once a new party president is elected. “That depends on the matter at that particular time. “It is not a tradition, it is not a norm. “But if the prevailing conditions determine that the president at that time must then vacate we base it on the situation at that time and live with that reality.” He also said they did not have a preferred candidate to be Ramaphosa’s deputy because the person would be elected in consultation with the ANC. Zikalala also lashed out at opposition parties for calling for the dissolution of Parliament and an early election to be held, saying that opposition parties were paranoid because they had no advantage over the ANC. “That’s opportunism, the opposition in South Africa think that the ANC is at its weakest stage. “Elections are held every five years, we’re not going to have early elections.” Daily News
