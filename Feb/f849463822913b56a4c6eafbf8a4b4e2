“The compounded effect of the continuing drought in the drier parts of the country and low commodity prices have ­created challenges for our customers and, by default, ourselves,” said Odendaal. However, he said they had resorted to offering their customers more solutions, consequently turning the year into a good business year for them. “We are very proud of the great new maize hybrids we are bringing to the marketplace this year. They include, subject to registration, seven new ultra-quick yellow hybrids with improved yield and disease ­tolerance. “We also have a new, ultra-quick, white Maize hybrid, PAN 3A-173, top in its class,” he said. But Pannar said they expected another challenging period this year. “Hopefully, with good rains in the second half of the season. “We always strive to be realistically positive and are confident the sector will once again produce enough to keep us self-sufficient,” said Odendaal. Agricultural Business Chamber head economist Wandile Sihlobo said he agreed with Pannar. “In the past year we harvested 16.7 million tons that led to maize costing R2 000 per ton and currently being at R1 787 per ton,” said Sihlobo. University of KwaZulu-Natal’s seed science and technology expert, Professor Albert Thembinkosi Modi, said poorer subsistence farmers were hardest hit. Daily News
