Durban - eThekwini Municipality will spend more than R4million on an electrification project at 14 000 subsidised homes within various projects in the city. This is according to a decision made by the eThekwini Human Settlements and Infrastructure Committee this week. According to Tozi Mthethwa, Head of the city’s Communication Unit, the committee has granted approval to the Electricity Unit to roll-out an electrification plan to houses that already built but are without electricity. “These will include RDP houses, disaster relief houses, R293 houses and four-roomed houses which were refurbished by the city. The homes that are not provided with electricity increase a risk of illegal connections. This poses a health and safety risk to the community,” she said. At the meeting, the committee also approved a title deeds restoration programme, which aims to finalise 3 000 title deeds within the current financial year. Mthethwa said 1 261 title deeds have been issued to date. “We have a backlog of 71 815 units for post 1994 and 11262 for pre 1994 stock that still has to be transferred to beneficiaries,” she said. The Department of Human Settlements within KwaZulu-Natal, has approved funding to the municipality for the appointment of service providers to undertake social facilitation and appointment of administrative workers to finalise beneficiary verification to clear backlog of title deeds in the city.
