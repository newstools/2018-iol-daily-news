Martin Rodrigues, Crocworld Conservation Centre’s manager, said the increased snake activity was not limited to black mambas. He said it was because February was an extremely hot and humid month, making snakes more active. Rodrigues, 32, a herpetologist of 12 years, said: “Black mambas can be found in most of KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, Limpopo and the North West province in a wide variety of habitats.” He said the black mamba was considered Africa’s most dangerous snake and if it felt cornered or threatened, it would defend itself. “Black mambas have a potent neurotoxic venom which affects the nervous and respiratory system. In the event that you are bitten, get to a hospital as soon as possible,” he said. Nick Evans, a snake catcher from KZN Amphibian and Reptile Conservation, said the loss of natural habitat had pushed snakes into suburbia. Evans, 24, said: “Adults are usually between 2.2m and 2.5m long and they’re thick, too. They’re dark grey in colour, with the name coming from the inside of their mouths.” He said black mambas were nervous and shy animals that want to be left alone. However, they are responsible for fatal attacks on dogs because dogs corner the snake, which leaves it no option but to defend itself. He said it was unnecessary to kill mambas as they are useful for rodent control. Both Evans and Rodrigues said that when you encountered any snake, you should keep a safe distance and not try to catch or kill it as this is when most snake bites occurred. You should either freeze or move away slowly and contact a trained professional to remove the snake. Captured snakes are released into their natural habitat.
