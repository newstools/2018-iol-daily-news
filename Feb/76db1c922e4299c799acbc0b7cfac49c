Durban - Three people implicated in a major drug bust in Phoenix last month, have abandoned their bail application. Jason Alexander, Shaun Mawesa, Justin Williams and Vuyani Nyawose appeared in the Verulam Magistrate's Court alongside their co-accused, husband and wife, Kevin and Desiree Periasamy and Periasamy’s brother, Calvin Periasamy. They face at least 30 charges including drug dealing, crimen injuria, robbery, intimidation, kidnapping and assault. The State has opposed bail for all seven accused. State Advocate Sasha Jacobs said Calvin Periasamy is wanted in connection with previous cases that included charges of  assault with intent to commit grievous bodily harm, kidnapping and murder. “It is alleged that if released on bail, the accused may interfere with witnesses,” Jacobs said. She added that there was huge public outcry against the accused being granted bail and given the circumstances of the charges, it would not be in the best interests of justice. The seven were arrested on January 25, following an extensive investigation. During the raid, police recovered R97 156 in cash, two pistols, a shotgun, 64 live rounds of ammunition, 1 836 heroin caps, 138 heroin straws, 80 large crack cocaine pieces, 30 mandrax tablets, three bags cocaine, two Ecstasy pills and 186g of dagga. According to a police source, the gang, known as the "Bloods" gang, had been allegedly dealing in drugs and are believed to be behind a spate of other crimes, including murder, in the area for many years.
