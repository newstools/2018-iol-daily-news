Durban - The father of a 13-year-old teenage girl was handed two life sentences for rape. The 53-year-old man from Matshana area in Empangeni was convicted and sentenced to two life terms for rape by the Empangeni Regional Court, said police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala. “In February 2013, the victim (13) was at her father’s homestead at Matshana area, Empangeni when she was called by her father to his bedroom. She was raped by her father and she reported the matter to her stepmother who was not at home on that day. The local police were called and a case of rape was opened at Empangeni police station,” explained Gwala. She said that the docket was transferred to Empangeni Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences unit for further investigation. After investigations, the man was arrested and charged with rape. “The accused was expected to look after his child and protect her against being abused by criminals, but instead, he raped her. This will serve as a stern warning to would-be criminals who intentionally abuse young children,” said Major General Bheki Langa, KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner. Daily News
