Durban - A week ago, nearly 100 graduate teachers protested in the Durban city centre over a lack of job opportunities in the profession. As a result, the Daily News created a Facebook poll asking its followers if they would be willing to pay more tax in order for the government to employ more teachers. Surprisingly, 80 percent said no and 20 percent said yes. This is what some of the followers had to say about the lack of job opportunities for teachers or an increase in tax in order to employ more teachers: Mvelo Mlungisi Qamata: The tax we currently paying is more than enough if they can utilize it properly and stop with the corruption there'd be more than enough money to do so many other things in this country... Raising tax means more money for the corrupt and greedy Stephen Lindeque: The government needs to stop wasting the tax which we already pay to them and employ people in vacant positions. Brenda Coleman: What about government getting rid of ghost teachers first as well as those that do not pitch to work daily. Employ those that are willing to work. Leon David: Cut down the number of positions and members of parliament and give the money towards paying for the employment of new teachers. Daily News
