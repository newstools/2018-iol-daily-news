Durban - The Competition Commission will be taking SA Airlink to the Competition Tribunal for predatory pricing, it said in a statement on Wednesday. The commission said they have received complaints alleged excessive and predatory pricing. The complaints were made between 2015 to 2017 by OR Tambo District Chamber of Business and Fly Blue Crane (Pty) Ltd among others. “The complaints were about the Johannesburg-Mthatha route (the route). The complainants alleged that SA Airlink’s prices were excessive before Fly Blue Crane entered the route. It was also alleged that SA Airlink then lowered its prices below its costs (predatory pricing) when Fly Blue Crane entered the route; and it was also alleged that SA Airlink went back to their exorbitant prices (excessive pricing) after Fly Blue Crane exited the route in January 2017,” the organisation said in a statement. The organisation conducted an investigation into the matter and discovered among other things, that SA Airlink contravened the Competition Act by misusing its dominance by charging sky-high prices between September 2012 to August 2016. It said users would have saved up to R108 million had SA Airlink not charged excessive prices. The predatory pricing of SA Airlink led to the demise of competitor Fly Blue Crane its only competitor on the route. SA Airlink’s predatory behaviour was likely to deter other people from entering the route it said. “The Commission seeks an administrative penalty of up to 10% of SA Airlink’s annual turnover for both the conduct of excessive pricing and predatory pricing. In addition, the Commission has asked the Tribunal to determine other appropriate remedies in order to correct the conduct,” the statement said. Hardin Ratshisusu, deputy commissioner of Competition Commission said they would be seeking the maximum penalty before the Competition Tribunal. Daily News
