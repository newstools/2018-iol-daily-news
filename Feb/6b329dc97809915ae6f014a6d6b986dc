Durban - When a woman came through the police station doors asking for help after she was allegedly raped, Durban police responded quickly and arrested a suspect before he could leave the area. It is alleged that the woman was given a lift from Dr Pixley KaSeme Street to the Durban beachfront earlier that afternoon. It is alleged the man took her to a quiet spot near the beachfront, where he wanted to speak to her privately. It is alleged he then pulled out a firearm and threatened the woman before demanding that she remove her underwear. The woman was then allegedly raped in the car. She managed to walk to the North Beach police station, where she met Warrant Officers Wenzil Naicker and Nad Moodley. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said Durban Central crime prevention members arrested the 39-year-old suspect at North Beach near a hotel. She said the suspect was found in possession of a pistol, five rounds of ammunition, a SAPS appointment certificate and a reflector jacket. Investigations would confirm if the man is indeed a registered police officer. "The suspect was linked to a rape that took place on the same day. The victim (35) alleges that she was raped by the same suspect, who pointed a firearm at her. The suspect has been charged with rape and unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition by Durban Central police," Mbhele said. Daily News
