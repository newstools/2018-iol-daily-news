Durban - A 72-year-old woman was attacked by a Rottweiler in Verulam, north of Durban on Wednesday. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) officers responded to the scene of the incident. Prem Balram, Rusa spokesperson, said Rusa officers found that the dog had bitten the woman multiple times. “Rusa were called out to the scene by residents who reported hearing a woman screaming for help. The elderly female explained that she was walking to a nearby business when the dog ran onto the road and repeatedly bit her on her leg. During the attack she was knocked to the ground and bitten on her hands and back. The woman attempted to push the dog away and screamed for help. The owner of the dog ran to her aid and managed to stop the dog from attacking further,” said Balram. He said the woman was treated at the scene for several bite wounds on her legs, hands and back, before being taken to a medical facility by the owner of the dog. Daily News
