Durban - A Port Shepstone woman who was hacked with a bush knife by her son last week has died in hospital. Last Monday, the Daily News reported that Siyamthanda Smith, 3, and Thobani Khwane, 4, were killed and their grandmother Mary Smith, 57, was admitted to hospital after a relative attacked them with a bush knife in Bhoboyi. Smith did not recover from the injuries to her head. Her family said she died at the Albert Luthuli Hospital on Thursday night. Her son, 21-year-old Siphamandla Smith, who committed the crime, was killed when a truck hit him on the N2 freeway near the home soon after the incident that Saturday. Thandeka Qwabe, a close relative, on Sunday told the Daily News the children were asleep in the same room as Smith when Siphamandla came in and an argument ensued. “Those who were here when it happened are still traumatised by what they saw. There was blood everywhere. We know he had a drug addiction problem, which altered his mood. The children and his mother were struck on the head, leaving deep gashes. Mary also, it seems, tried to defend herself or prevent the bush knife from hitting her. She lost a few fingers and had a swollen eye. She must have been punched. She was unconscious in hospital,” Qwabe said. Qwabe said they were still making funeral arrangements. Daily News
