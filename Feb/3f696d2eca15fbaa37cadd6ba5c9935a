Durban's Monkey Helpline was at the Westville Police station on Wednesday trying to open up charges against a man who shot a monkey dead with a pellet gun a short  in Cotswold Drive. Steve Smit, the founder of Monkey Helpline, was infuriated after the monkey died in his arms. "A lactating adult female monkey was shot in her chest and left drowning in her own blood in front of her terrified baby. The shooter admitted he shot his pellet gun at the monkeys but denies he shot this mommy. He was insisting he was actually shooting at the adult male monkey," Smit said. With the mother's milk dripping down Steve's hand, and her blood pouring out a hole into her chest they made their way to the Westville Police Station. "This Cotswold Drive, Westville shooter must pay for his actions. Hoping Westville Police and the Kloof SPCA work with us to bring this killer to book," Smit added. "The baby is now an orphan, a tag along with little chance of survival and no way to fend or feed. Still a suckling, this tot will die a slow death from starvation if we don't find him or her before this happens," Smith said. Daily News
