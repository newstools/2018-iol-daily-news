Durban - Durban’s Chloe Tryon is fast becoming South Africa’s big hitter in the Momentum Proteas set-up. In the recently concluded T20 International Series between the Proteas Women and India Women Tryon has been hailed as South Africa’s big hitter. The 24-year-old has been in the Proteas setup since her T20 debut in May 2010 against West Indies Women and has also gone on to represent her country in more than 50 One-Day International matches and one Test match. Tryon played in all five T20 matches and managed to score 108 runs. In the first T20 in Potchefstroom, the left-hand batter scored an unbeaten 32 runs from just seven balls (2 fours and four sixes). In the third fixture, she scored 34 runs off 15 deliveries, which pushed the Proteas close to victory, with only three runs needed on the scoreboard for victory. After the first three T20 matches, she said power hitting is one of her favourite parts of her training regimen and she enjoys pressure situations. “I’ve been preparing really well,” she said. “I’ve been working really hard on the batting and just being really positive when I go out there. I like being under pressure when I go and bat and I enjoy batting when the team is under pressure, it forces me to be calm and do what I do best.” This was her scorecard in all five matches - 32*, 15, 34, 2 and 25 runs respectively. In her lowest score of only two runs, she had been moved up the batting order to number three, to continue her stretch of good form but was quickly dismissed. Daily News
