Durban - The parents of baby Brayden have called on the public to hold him in their prayers because his condition has worsened. His mother, Samantha Chane Weideman asked people to come together for a power prayer at 1pm on Monday. She said he truly needs a miracle. It has been an emotional roller-coaster for the parents of 2-year-old Brayden Chase Daw, who was rescued from a burning house in Escombe last Saturday.Brayden is in the Intensive Care Unit at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital. Sixty percent of his body is covered in first- and second-degree burns. Brayden was asleep next to his mother, Weideman, when the house caught fire. His mother climbed out of the bathroom window. She tried to get a grip and then grab Brayden from the sink that she left him in but fell to the ground when the pipes gave way from the wall. Firemen rushed into the burning house and took Brayden to safety.

They did another blood transfusion to bring up the platelets. He has a chest infection but it looks like the antibiotics are working. If he is stable enough to move around, the doctors will clean his wounds.” Earlier in the week, he had a chest infection which prevented him from having a skin graft operation scheduled to take place last Friday. “On Wednesday, his vitals and everything looked good. He went into theatre to get his wounds cleaned and have new bandages put on. The wounds were much worse than they expected. We’re hoping and praying for a great outcome and he heals back to full health,” Weideman said. “I want to thank everyone for all the generosity they have shown in donating us things. We really do appreciate it. If we could all just say a prayer for little Brayden. He is our everything, our whole world. May God watch over him and help him fight through this.” Daily News
