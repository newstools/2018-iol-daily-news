Durban - Workers at Durban’s Magwaza Maphalala (Gale) Street mortuary have downed tools. Speaking to the Daily News on Tuesday morning, staff said they were tired of working under abusive conditions. According to one of the workers, who asked not to be named, they have lodged a number of complaints with management over the behaviour of two staff members. “To this day, nothing gets done. Some of us have been working here for many years and we are regularly sworn at and pushed around. One of the workers was almost assaulted in full view of other employees and union representatives,” he said. Another worker said she changed her work shift so that she avoided seeing the two employees. “After some time that shift became inconvenient for me and I changed back to my old shift. The abuse continued. I have been working here for the last 11 years,” she said. In a petition signed by staff, employees are demanding that both workers be removed or relocated as they feel intimidated, threatened and victimised. According to a worker, the morgue receives on average 12 bodies per day for post mortems. Daily News
