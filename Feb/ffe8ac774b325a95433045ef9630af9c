The 33-time Deaflympic medalist’s efforts to support the deaf got him honoured by the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation as their Global Brand Ambassador for the deaf and blind last year. According to Sea Rescue South Africa statistics, 600 children drown each year. Parkin is determined to change this with support from the foundation. Completing the 902km was not easy for him. He cycled for five days across 723km in Sani Pass-steep terrain, and he swam 13km at the Midmar Mile as part of the Eight Mile Club. He also ran 33km, which was so challenging he needed a little extra support. “My support team were amazing. They left the vehicle to run alongside me, and a few of the local children even joined in. “It’s an honour to perform a challenge such as this in our country with its beautiful landscapes,” Parkin said. His last challenge was to canoe 124km in the three-day Dusi Canoe Marathon with long-time canoeist Mark Mulder. Princess Charlene of Monaco, a swimmer for the South African team who swam with Parkin, said: “Terence is an incredible athlete who has shown dedication and passion for his sport, and has never allowed any obstacles to stand in his way on his path to achieve success. We are proud of the amazing work he does for the foundation in support of water safety and drowning prevention.” The challenge was worth it to Parkin. “I want to help children reach their full potential. Swimming has been an incredibly positive influence in my life, physically, emotionally and personally, and I want 
children with hearing difficulties and other challenges to share my experience,” he said. Ryk Neethling, a  fellow Olympian and chief executive of the foundation in South Africa, expressed his support. “Terence is known as one of the world’s toughest athletes. He is paving the way for youngsters across South Africa to live their dreams, no matter what the odds are.” Daily News
