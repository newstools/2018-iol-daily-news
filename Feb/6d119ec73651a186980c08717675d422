Sandra Naysmith, 71, was in her home when she was attacked by three men at the Mayfield Complex on Monday. Neighbours were still in shock from the incident when the Daily News visited the gated complex on Tuesday. Andreas Mathios, Blue Security spokesperson, said three armed robbers gained entry to the complex property around 3.15am. “They broke a window and forced open a burglar guard at the back of the property before going upstairs where they assaulted Sandra Naysmith. “The suspects stabbed her twice in the abdomen and hit her on the head. "Her fingers were also bruised when the suspects pulled off her rings before they fled the scene. "During the scuffle, the woman managed to press the panic alarm.” Mathios said an armed response officer had responded to the scene and confronted the robbers. “Residents pointed the officer in the direction of a bush of flowers they had seen the robbers flee into. "When the officer approached the flower bush, two suspects, one armed with a knife, jumped out of hiding and lunged towards him. "The officer fired a gunshot into the ground. "The suspects fled in different directions. "A third suspect jumped out of the bush. The officer managed to grab him, but he resisted arrest and fought back. “Unfortunately, the officer had to hold on to his firearm during the scuffle and the suspect managed to break free and escape.” Captain Nqobile Gwala, a police spokesperson, said Naysmith was stabbed in the upper abdomen and was taken to hospital for medical attention. She was later discharged. A case of house robbery is being investigated by Hillcrest SAPS. Attempts to contact Naysmith were unsuccessful as she had moved in with her family after the incident.
