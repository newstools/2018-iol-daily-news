Durban - A young woman is fighting for her life in a Durban hospital after she was struck by a minibus taxi in KwaMashu on Friday morning. Crisis Medical Emergency Services were called to the scene on the M25 KwaMashu Highway after 7.30am, and found a 25-year-old woman lying in the road, said spokesperson Kyle van Reenen. He said the woman had suffered serious injuries. “Advanced life support intervention was needed to stabilise her before she was placed on a mechanical ventilator to assist her in breathing,” said Van Reenen. He said they called for assistance from the Department of Health’s Red Cross Air Mercy Services aeromedical helicopter for the woman to be airlifted to Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital, where a team of surgeons was waiting for her arrival. Van Reenen said traffic was affected because the road was closed to traffic to allow the helicopter to land. Police are investigating the incident. Daily News
