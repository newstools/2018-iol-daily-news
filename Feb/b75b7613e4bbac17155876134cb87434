This was confirmed on Sunday by Brigadier-General Mafi Mgobozi, SANDF spokesperson. Mgobozi said they first heard of the allegations on Friday from the army’s “sources”. “It shocked us greatly,” Mgobozi said. The team of investigators are to leave within the week and conduct their investigations over a two-week period, he said. The 5th Battalion are part of the peacekeeping operations in Goma in the North Kivu province. It has more than 1 000 soldiers stationed in the area. Mgobozi said it was not only the 5th Battalion, but the support staff who would be investigated. He added that the investigations would be conducted in participation with the UN. “If soldiers were to be implicated in  wrongdoing, they would immediately be sent back to the country,” he said. The infantry personnel would face charges in front of military courts but Mgobozi said he did not know what sort of sentences they would face if found guilty. UN peacekeepers have over the years faced many charges of sexual exploitation and abuse in the DRC. Stephanie Wolters, head of the Peace and Security Research programme at the Institute of Security Studies, said internationally there had been many soldiers accused of misbehaviour. “It is a vulnerable environment with a vulnerable people,” Wolters said. She said the great inequality in the country made it easy for people to be abused. Wolters also noted that it was difficult for the UN and peacekeeping countries to keep the situation under control. Abuse by UN peacekeepers was not a new phenomenon. “It is reprehensible and should not be allowed and must be punished,” Wolters said. She said this was exacerbated by the DRC’s national army also contributing to the breakdown of law as they were also involved in abuses. Daily News
