Durban - The KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) legislature’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has hailed the Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs (EDTEA) for the introduction and implementation of stringent interventions to strengthen prudent financial management. Maggie Govender, Scopa chairperson, said she noted the improvement in the audit outcomes and that the Department and its entities did not incur fruitless expenditure. "There has been consistency in adhering to the policy of paying service providers within 30 days. This is highly commendable. We want to thank EDTEA MEC, Sihle Zikalala and his team for this,” Govender said at the legislature earlier today. Welcoming the accolades from Scopa, Zikalala said stringent financial controls were a catalyst for quality service delivery. “We are happy that our financial control measures are beginning to bear fruit. The positive comments we have received from Scopa members from various political parties are very encouraging. We now have concrete plans of avoiding irregular, unauthorised, and fruitless expenditure which will enable us to accelerate service delivery to our people,” Zikalala said. He said as a department that championed radical economic transformation and promoted the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises, they could not afford to delay paying service providers as this impacted negatively on their balance sheets. "We have heard of retrenchments and the closing down of small and medium-sized enterprises as a result of payment delays. This is unacceptable and needs to change,” he said. Daily News
