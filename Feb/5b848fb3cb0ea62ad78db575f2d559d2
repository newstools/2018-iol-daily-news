Durban - The 26-year-old man arrested for allegedly throwing rocks onto vehicles along the N3, will have to wait until Monday next week, to find out if he will be granted bail. Nkosinathi Mthalane made his second appearance in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Monday where the State said the initial charge of malicious damage to property would fall away and Mthalane would instead be charged with attempted murder. Mathalane was arrested almost two weeks ago after he allegedly threw rocks onto passing vehicles on the N3, near the Tollgate bridge. The first incident took place just after 6.30am on the N3, just after Ridge Road. An hour later, a rock was thrown on to a second vehicle. According to police, the first driver was taken to the police station when the suspect for the second incident was arrested. The suspect was identified as being the same person in both instances. There have been one of several in the past few months causing damage to vehicles, claiming lives and injuring several others. In December, Amina and Abdur Raheem Haffejee were killed on the N2 near Ballito when a rock was thrown at the car they were travelling in. The city has since placed bridge patrollers on pedestrian bridges over the N3 between Warwick Triangle and Westville. Daily News
