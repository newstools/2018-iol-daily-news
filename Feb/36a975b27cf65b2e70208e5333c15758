The news quickly spread and while some foreigners living in Durban were positively surprised, others were saddened. Albert Hororo, vice-chairperson of the Diakonia Council Of Churches, felt Zuma’s resignation was long overdue. “People in government work to please their own interests. Had Zuma listened and not been stubborn when he was advised to step down long ago, while advisers were willing to bargain with him, the issue would have been resolved quickly,” Hororo said. Kudzai Taruona from the Methodist Seminary felt the way Zuma had ended up stepping down was embarrassing for someone of his calibre. He said the Zuma name had an important role to play in South African politics. “He (Zuma) could have easily stepped down and kept his reputation clean, but instead he was defiant and chose to ruin his reputation and all the good work he had done,”  he said. Transition It also became clear that in foreign countries, the transition from one president to another was not always as peaceful. Taurona pointed out that South Africans were privileged to have an independent press. In his country, Zimbabwe, even the few that did try to speak out against Mugabe would not be heard. “After a few days of trying to speak up and report against him, they would get tired and the topic would change,” Taurona said. “This is very different from South Africa.” Tony Joseph, a business owner from Nigeria, said the Nigerian government was unsatisfactory, but so powerful no one could bring them down.
