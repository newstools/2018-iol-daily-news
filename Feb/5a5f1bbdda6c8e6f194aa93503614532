On Monday, the SA National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) was responding to complaints by motorists using the N2 North between Salt Rock Road and the Tinley Manor off-ramp, particularly to the industrial and residential areas nearby. Zahir Danbar, a resident of Phoenix who travels the route, lambasted Sanral for abandoning the two construction sites without any safety measures and reducing the freeway to a single lane. “Construction has been abandoned for more than a year. Yet we pay the R10 toll fees. We use toll roads because it is supposed to be faster, more efficient and safer. We don’t use it to be held up every day in traffic,” Danbar said. Construction began in April 2016 and should have been completed by June 2017. While Sanral would not reveal the cost of this contract, Ravi Ronny, Sanral eastern region design and planning manager, said the project involved the upgrading of two sections of the N2 freeway. “Both of the upgrades are being undertaken under one contract. Work stopped when it was found that the material being used was not meeting specifications. The contractor could not obtain suitable material in order to achieve the required specifications in terms of contract,” Ronny said. Daily News
