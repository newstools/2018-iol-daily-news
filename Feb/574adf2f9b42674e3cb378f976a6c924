Sizwe Ka Kupelo, a Mthatha resident, posted on Facebook that the bus overturned while attempting to avoid a stray animal on the N2 between Tsolo and Mthatha. He said 20 people sustained minor injuries and were rushed to Mthatha Regional Hospital. While officials have yet to confirm this, another person living in the vicinity confirmed the incident on Facebook.  Bonke Dumisa alleged the bus driver lost control when he avoided sheep that invaded the N2 and nearly caused a mass car crash. Dumisa called for something to be done about the Eastern Cape/ Transkei livestock that roam on the busy national highways. Alungile Qumba commented saying this particular road between Tsolo and Mthatha is often occupied by stray animals. “The last time I checked, the Roads and Public Works in the province had employed road rangers in trying to curb such caterstrophies, but honestly speaking, farmers can be ignorant and selfish at time,” Qumba said. Translux said there were no deaths or serious injuries to passengers. Daily News
