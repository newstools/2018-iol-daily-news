Durban - Workers at Truro House, which houses mostly government employees have decided to boycott the building after identifying numerous complaints about the building on Friday morning. The most recent is that the building has been without electricity since Thursday morning, said a source who cannot be named as she is not authorised to speak to media. “We were told that there is no electricity due to cable theft but they are fixing the problem,” the source who works in the building said. The source said in addition, their telephone lines have been down for weeks because the phone bill has not been paid. “We were told that someone was coming to address us but later we were told that they will not be able to make it because they suddenly have a meeting in Pretoria,” said the source. The source said that some workers decided to sit outside because no work is being done inside and that it is too hot in the building. “It is too hot besides having no electricity, the aircon has been broken since January. There is also an unpleasant smell on certain floors in the building,” the source continued. The source also said that before, some floors did not have water but now it is back. “The building just keeps getting worse,” the source concluded. Kwazi Mthethwa, KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education spokesperson said the department is aware of the issues facing the building. “This has has been reported and we are dealing with it. It is unfortunate that this is happening to this building that houses government people - there is health, education and so on. We are not ignoring these issues, there is work being done at the moment,” said Mthethwa. Daily News
