The money, according to the report, would come from the capital programmes budget for the 2019/20 financial year, but R7.2m would be paid in this financial year. This would help the metro police start the process of addressing challenges caused by infrastructure that had become old and outdated. The balance would continue to be used to complete the projects next year. According to the report, the work to be undertaken would include repairs to buildings, the installation of new air conditioners, building of new stables as well as building a new police station in Verulam. Cameras would also be installed and monitored to mitigate the risk of loss in the uniform stores and armoury. The report noted that some buildings leaked when it rained, electrical wires and cables ran through the walls, while the sewerage in some buildings needed attention. There was also a need to build new stables for the metro police since the horses would be moved from the New Market Stables. Speaking at an executive committee meeting before full council, deputy city manager of finance Krish Kumar said it was not unusual to bring expenditure forward if there was cash flow available. Deputy Mayor Fawzia Peer, also the chairperson of the security and emergency services committee, said the metro police headquarters were in a bad state. “We need to manage our buildings to ensure they are not in a dilapidated state, which in the end will cost even more to repair,” she said. Buildings to be revamped include the metro police headquarters at Archie Gumede Place, the Training Academy, the KwaMashu police station, Verulam police station, Khuzimpi Shezi police station in uMlazi, a new metro police horse unit and Queensburgh stores. DA councillor Shaun Riley said the development was welcomed, even though the situation could have been avoided. Daily News
