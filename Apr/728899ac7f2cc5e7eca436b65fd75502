Durban - Three men had to swim for two hours to make it to shore after the boat they were in capsized along the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal. Craig Lambinon, Sea Rescue spokesperson, said the men from Gauteng had launched a 19 foot ski-boat, Salticrack, to go fishing off Sodwana on Friday. On Saturday, Isimangaliso Wetland staff searched along the shoreline South of Sodwana and Advantage Charters conducted sea search patrols and NSRI St Lucia crew launched a private boat Boetie to search for the missing boat. Other charter and private boats were tasked to keep a look-out. Lambinon said the boat was found washed ashore 13.8km south of Sodwana by Isimangaliso Wetland staff who arranged for the boat to be recovered. “It has been confirmed that the three men were capsized by a wave at around 10.30am, they drifted sitting on the upturned hull for over four hours, but they kept being washed off the hull which was causing them to become exhausted,” he said. “Noticing that they were drifting South but not getting any closer to shore one of the men dived under the boat to recover life-jackets and they made the decision to swim to shore with their life-jackets on and the swim took them just over two hours,” he continued. He said the men swam to shore and were sunburnt and tired. They marked their position by leaving their life-jackets on the beach to attract attention to anyone who might be searching for them and to mark where they had come ashore to give an indication of where a search should begin for their capsized craft adrift at sea. “While walking Northwards towards Sodwana they were located by My Lady Charters who were searching the shoreline using 4x4 vehicles. They were found at around 18h00,” he said. Daily News
