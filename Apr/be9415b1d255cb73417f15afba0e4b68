Earlier in the week, the MK veterans staged a protest outside the city hall, bringing traffic to a standstill in the central business district. The veterans had tried to stop staff from leaving the city hall and metro police had to intervene. The protest caused massive traffic jams that lasted more than two hours and left motorists irate. Sipho Nzuza, the eThekwini Municipal manager, intervened and entered into discussions with the aggrieved veterans. Gumede said: “Job opportunities are available, provided that they are qualified,” he said. They would also look at hiring more staff and improve how they dealt with the needs of the veterans. Other veterans who would be employed were from the Azanian People’s Liberation Army and other organisations. Veterans with disabilities would also be accommodated, he said. Gumede said some veterans would start work as soon as next week and they would be looking for opportunities for others in other sectors like parastatals. Langa Dube, of the MK Vets Business Task Team, said there were a number of veterans who had skills and were in business, but they were worried about those who were unskilled and needed to be skilled so that they could get work opportunities.
