Durban - The Zulu Kingdom will play host to the Nedbank Cup semi-finals this weekend. The semi-finals will be played on Saturday and Sunday in the stadiums named after the province’s political leaders. Kaizer Chiefs will make the iconic Moses Mabhida Stadium their home ground when they take on Free State Stars in their semi-final clash on Saturday. The Nedbank is Chiefs’ last shot at winning a title under the leadership of Steve Komphela before his contract runs out, now that they are out of the Absa Premiership title race. The next day, Harry Gwala Stadium will host Maritzburg United and Mamelodi Sundowns. United face a tough outing against Sundowns who are set to take the Premiership if Orlando Pirates stumble. Ticket prices are R60 for adults and R15 for children under the age of 12. Tickets can be purchased at TicketPro outlets including Edgars, Jet Stores, Postnet and CNA.
