KwaZulu-Natal police estimate the protest caused more than R20 million in damage to property. Provincial SAPS spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the suspects made a brief appearance at the Mooi River Magistrate’s Court last Tuesday and the case was adjourned to April 24. Zwane was, however, unsure if the men were granted bail or remanded. A Mooi River police officer, who commented on condition of anonymity, said those arrested had a stash of stolen alcohol with them. “The suspects are among those who targeted the truck which was making a delivery to Spar Tops in Mooi River. The other truck was delivering groceries,” said the officer. A Spar Tops Mooi River employee said the trucks were delivering stock from Utrecht and Newcastle. He referred the Daily News to Spar’s headquarters in KZN, who had not commented at the time of publication. The protesters barricaded the route to the Mooi River toll plaza with burning tyres and rubble, before turning on the cargo trucks. Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson Zinhle Mngomezulu said five trucks were torched. Mzwandile Chonco, a parliamentary constituency officer in Mpofana Municipality, said the protest was not organised by the community but by truck drivers.“These drivers allege there are trucking companies that employ foreign nationals, leaving the locals high and dry. They brought the protest to our area, and locals hijacked it with no knowledge of what it was all about,” Chonco said. The Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry said businesses whose trucks were damaged in the protest had suffered significantly. Chamber president Musa Makhunga said the KZN economy was affected and such behaviour could not become the norm in addressing social issues in South Africa. “The chamber suggests that negotiation is vital to reduce the ripple effects of the protest action,” Makhunga said .
