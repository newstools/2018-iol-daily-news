Durban - The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) has taken to picketing at the KwaZulu-Natal Basic Education Department in an attempt to force the department to pay-up outstanding salary increases for the grade R teachers. Nomarashiya Caluza, Sadtu provincial secretary, said the over due payment was from April 2017 to date. There were 5 827 qualified and unqualified grade R teachers in the province, according to the education department’s report released around November last year. Caluza said the department owed each teacher between R750 and R1 250. “This affects our members’ performance a great deal. Those that have the BEd qualification were promised a R1250 increase while those who are underqualified are owed R750. This brings the amount owed to individuals from April 2017 to around R15 000," Caluza said. "The non-payment of this increment make them feel like they don’t matter, they are worthless and how then do expect great performance from the same people you are undermining? Government preaches that early childhood development is important. Who will develop these children when these educators are not taken seriously? We will picket until this issue is resolved,” she said. This comes as the department faces a financial crunch.The Daily News reported last month that Minister Angie Motshekga was planning to intervene. She had planned to meet with the National Teachers’ Union leadership late last month to discuss allegations the union had made that the department in the province had mismanaged funds. A Durban teacher who asked not to be named said the funds' mismanagement were reported after they were promised the increase. “How then does it change the fact that we are owed money? The minister and those below her must sort mismanagement out without interfering with what’s due to us,” said the teacher. Daily News
