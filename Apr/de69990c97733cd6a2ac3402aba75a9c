Samishka Singh, 21, left, from Effingham Heights, was crowned first princess, while Tesarnia Oree, 19, right, from South Beach, was the second princess. The pageant’s organiser, Kamisha Nanhoo, said the pageant was based on fashion, deportment, grooming, etiquette and the question-and-answer section. “This pageant gives young ladies the opportunity to showcase themselves, as well as get involved in the fashion industry, modelling, television and radio presenting and acting. It’s a programme based on boosting your confidence,” she said. Daily News
