The Hindu community and other onlookers were gathered to celebrate this annual Good Friday ceremony when a storm started and filled the 5m-long fire pit with water. More than 500 devotees who were ready to fulfil their vows to Goddess Draupadi - also referred to as the mother of fire - by walking barefoot across the pit were left disappointed when told they could not participate in the fire-walking ritual. It is alleged that the Msunduzi Municipality fire department called for the ceremony to be abandoned because the hot pit was waterlogged, which could have caused dangerous underfoot conditions. Jugathesan Padayachee, the safety officer for the event, said the rain had soaked the fire pit and it was slippery and wet. “We could not let anyone walk on the soaked fire pit because of the dangers that could come from slipping or steam burns,” he said. Sunny Naidoo, president of the Sri Siva Soobramoniar and Marrieamen Temples, said it was very disappointing that the ceremony had to be cancelled because, as far as he recalled, it had not been cancelled in five decades. “It is very unfortunate, but we will have to wait until next year,” Naidoo said. The Hindu tradition dates back centuries in India and has been practised in KwaZulu-Natal for decades. Daily News
