Durban - It was an unpleasant Easter Sunday for a Gillitts woman who was held up by armed robbers in her home and robbed of her valuables. Andreas Mathios, Blue Security Community and Media Liaison Officer, said two men had jumped over the fence to gain entry to the property before working through a backdoor that was left open. “The robbers, both armed with knives, accosted the resident as she walked from her bedroom to the lounge. They told her to keep quiet and demanded cash,” Mathios said. “They demanded that she open the safe from which they removed a wedding ring. They then tied up the resident and searched the house for other valuables, fleeing with cash, a laptop, an iPad, jewellery and two bags. No injuries were reported,” he continued. He said Hillcrest police were also at the scene of the incident. He also advised residents keep security gates and doors locked. “Even if your doors are open make sure that the security gate is locked and that the key is not anywhere in sight nearby. At least this will buy you some time in an emergency as burglars are unlikely to smash open a security gate without making a noise and alerting you to their presence so you can press your panic button,” he said.
