Mngxitama was addressing the media at a press conference called by a number of pro-Zuma organisations, to outline how they would support Zuma when he appears in the Durban High Court on Friday. Zuma is expected to appear before Judge Themba Sishi on 16 charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering. Mngxitama said Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, like Zuma, had also been a victim of white monopoly capital because of her stance on transformation. He said it was a mistake not to defend Madikizela-Mandela when she was vilified. “When she was vilified, when she was dragged to court for concocted charges against her and convicted, we allowed the enemy of black people to separate us from her.” Church leaders, including KwaZulu-Natal ANC MPL Bishop Vusi Dube, have pledged their support for Zuma. Dube, the co-leader of the pro-Zuma National Interfaith of South Africa and Commission for Religious Affairs, held a press briefing yesterday to outline how the “Hands off Zuma” vigil tonight and protest march to the high court tomorrow would be conducted. “On Friday we want everyone to come out to support Msholozi,” said Dube. He said he supported Zuma in his capacity as a religious leader, and under the ANC banner. The church leaders are working with the National Funeral Practitioners Association of South Africa, BLF, Delangokubona Business Forum, Asidle Sonke Business Forum and the National Unemployed People’s Trust to mobilise support for Zuma. The Zuma supporters said they had organised more than 100 buses to transport supporters to the city. “These groups were mobilising differently to support Msholozi, but we saw it fit to unite them because we are working towards a common purpose. “We cannot allow our community to be without leadership,” said Dube.
