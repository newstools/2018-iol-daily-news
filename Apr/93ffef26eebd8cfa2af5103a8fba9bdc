Durban - Durban commuters will not be affected by the nationwide bus strike that is expected to start on Wednesday. The eThekwini Municipality has advised bus commuters that Durban Transport staff are not expected to be part of the national strike. “Durban Transport employees, through their unions negotiate separately from the national structure and already have an agreement on their annual salary increase with their employer (Tansnat),” said a statement issued by eThekwini Municipality’s Communication Unit. The statement also said Durban Transport buses are expected to operate as normal on Wednesday. According to a statement issued by Golden Arrow Bus Services, the bus strike is a result of a deadlock in wage negotiations. “Negotiations are still taking place and Golden Arrow remains hopeful that an agreement can still be reached. If the strike action goes ahead, Golden Arrow will institute a Company-wide lock-out in order to ensure the safety of our passengers and staff for the duration of the strike,” the statement said.
