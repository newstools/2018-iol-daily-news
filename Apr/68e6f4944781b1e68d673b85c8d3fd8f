Durban - Durban’s long-distance bus terminal, Durban Station, was eerily quiet on Wednesday as a national bus strike took effect. Most of the bus liners were not running on Wednesday as many of the bus drivers joined the strike. Bus services, Intercape, Apm and Intercity told the Daily News that their staff were not partaking in the strike, while Translux, Greyhound, Citiliner and City to City said their staff had joined the strike. Greyhound and Citiliner said they had sent out text messages to their passengers, informing them about the strike. While the Daily News was at the station, a Greyhound bus arrived from Welkom and the passengers said they were not affected by the strike. Suzan van Wyk, 37, said she boarded the bus at 2am. Van Wyk said she lives in Durban and was in Welkom for three days for private business. Another passenger, who refused to be named, said she boarded a Greyhound bus in Ladysmith on Wednesday morning. She was told that her bus would not be affected by the strike. She also said the bus she boarded was said to be from Cape Town. The eThekwini Municipality had advised bus commuters that Durban Transport staff were not expected to be part of the national strike. According to a statement issued by Golden Arrow Bus Services, the bus strike is a result of a deadlock in wage negotiations. “Negotiations are still taking place and Golden Arrow remains hopeful that an agreement can still be reached. If the strike action goes ahead, Golden Arrow will institute a Company-wide lock-out in order to ensure the safety of our passengers and staff for the duration of the strike,” the statement said.
