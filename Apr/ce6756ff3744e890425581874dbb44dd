Durban - Police arrested 16 people and recovered 17 firearms on Friday. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, police spokesperson, said on Friday a group of heavily armed men travelling in a Toyota Quantum minibus taxi, stormed the taxi rank in Brook Street, in Durban. “They fired multiple gunshots and sped off. Three people were seriously injured and taken to hospital for medical attention and a 56-year-old later passed away. The suspects fled towards Pinetown and a police officer from the Pinetown Task Team spotted the suspects’ vehicle in Chelsea Avenue, New Germany and gave chase. The suspects opened fire at him and he retaliated,” Mbhele said. She said no one was injured during the shootout and the gunmen abandoned the taxi and ran into a building in Scott Road, in Pinetown. This resulted in the National Intervention Unit being called in. “A total of 16 suspects were arrested and a total of 17 firearms were seized which include nine rifles, a shotgun and seven pistols,” she said. She said the men will be charged for murder and attempted murder, including the shooting of a police officer in Pinetown. She also said they will be charged for the illegal possession of firearms and will appear in court soon. She said the firearms will be subjected to ballistic testing to check if they were used in other crimes. Major General Bheki Langa, KwaZulu-Natal Acting Police Commissioner said, “In this province, we will not tolerate any violence especially relating to taxi industry as members of community are normally caught during the exchange of gunfire. We work diligently to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to book.” Daily News
