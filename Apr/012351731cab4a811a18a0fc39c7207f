Durban - A memorial service in memory of the victims of the recent tavern murders near Margate is expected to be held soon. Bekezela Khowa whose nephew and friends died in the attack said the families are still in shock over the senseless killings. “We can’t believe it. At the moment we’re busy with plans for a joint memorial service for all the victims at one of the high school halls in the area. After that each family will hold their own funeral service.” Police are working around the clock to track down a second suspect involved in an incident at a tavern this week which left four people dead. The suspects held up patrons at Mama’s Tavern in Lamont Township near Margate on Monday night. They robbed the patrons of their belongings before shooting four of them in the head, three of whom died at the scene. The fourth victim later died in hospital from gunshot injuries. By Tuesday police had tracked down one suspect who was found in possession of an unlicensed firearm with eleven rounds of ammunition. The firearm has been sent for ballistic tests. The suspects stole cash, liquor and a cellphone before fleeing the scene on foot. Police are investigating charges of murder, attempted murder, assault GBH and robbery. In an unrelated matter, police are also investigating an incident reported at a tavern in the Umkomaas area where three armed suspects robbed patrons there, stealing cellphones and TV set. They fired shots inside the premises, wounding three people. Upon fleeing the tavern they shot and killed a 34-year-old patron and shot at another patron who was driving into the premises at time. He was unharmed. In this case charges of murder, attempted murder and robbery are being investigated. Police have appealed to anyone with information on these attacks to call 08600 10111. Daily News
