A member of the family, who asked not to be named, said a landscaper had been working at their home at the weekend when he found it. “He was digging and preparing the ground when 
he found it, took it out and 
put it against the wall,” she said. She said the man had sprayed the bomb with water, not knowing what it was. When they saw it, they thought it was just an old relic. It was only after they searched the internet that they realised what it was. They went to the local police station to report the matter, but could not get 
any assistance there, so a friend called the SAPS bomb squad who quickly went to the scene. Members of the bomb squad told them that the mortar was still live and took it to detonate it elsewhere. The landscaper was horrified when they told him what had happened, because he had cleaned it with a hosepipe. The bomb squad would return with a metal detector to see if there were any more bombs on the property, she said. The family was, however, not worried about stepping on any other bombs, as the one that was found was about 2m deep when it was dug up. Daily News
