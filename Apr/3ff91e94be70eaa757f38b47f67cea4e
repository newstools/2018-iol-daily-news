Durban - The man arrested last August for being involved in killings at Glebelands Hostel in uMlazi, south of Durban, was found guilty of the murder of Sbongile Mtshali. On Thursday the Durban Regional Court convicted Khayelihle Mroza Mbuthuma, 28 of murder. He was expected to be sentenced on Tuesday. At the time, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, police spokesperson, said Mbuthuma was arrested during an intelligence driven operation by police at Glebelands looking for suspects involved in murders at the hostel. It is where the police located and arrested Mbuthuma who was wanted for Mtshali’s murder. “It is alleged on July 26, 2017 at 8pm, the victim Sbongile Mtshali was at room where she was running a tuck-shop when she was approached by two unknown men pretending to be customers. The suspects opened fire, fatally wounding Mtshali before fleeing the crime scene on foot. She sustained gunshot wounds to the head and chest and was declared dead at the scene. The arrested suspect will be profiled to establish if he is linked to other cases committed at Glebelands hostel,” Zwane said. Daily News
