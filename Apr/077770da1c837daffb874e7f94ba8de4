Durban - Kaizer Chiefs supporters turned another soccer match into a war zone after Kaizer Chiefs lost 2-0 to Free State Stars in the Nedbank Cup semi-final. The Nedbank Cup was Chiefs' last chance at silverware in three seasons. After the final whistle, fans invaded the pitch, attacked security guards and destroyed property. This led Steve Komphela to quit as coach of Chiefs. Kyle van Reenen of Marshall Security said, “A public disturbance and protest action has erupted after a football game at Durban’s iconic Moses Mabhida Stadium. Umgeni Road is currently closed to traffic in the vicinity of the stadium. The necessary authorities are in attendance.” Van Reenen also urged the public to avoid the area. Stars had scored both goals in the first half, leaving Chiefs with a mountain to climb in the second half of the match. Two weeks ago, Chiefs supporters had thrown objects onto the pitch after their 3-0 loss at the hands of Chippa United at the FNB Stadium on April 7. As a result the club was fined R250 000 by the Premier Soccer League Disciplinary Committee. Chiefs were charged for spectator behaviour, resulting from the club’s failure to provide adequate security at the match. Chiefs had decided to make the iconic Moses Mabhida Stadium one of their home grounds in the 2017/18 season and the previous season. Daily News
