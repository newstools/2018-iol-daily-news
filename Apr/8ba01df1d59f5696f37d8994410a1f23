Durban - UMhlanga homeowners were left shaken after four armed men entered their home and fled with their possessions. Kyle van Reenen of Marshall Security, said Marshall Security responded to a report of a house robbery in Ridge Road on Friday morning. Van Reenen said reports from the scene of the incident said four armed men forced entry into the home and confined the homeowners into a bedroom while they ransacked the home. “The men stole various items including four flat screen televisions and cell phones, before making off in the family's Range Rover vehicle,” he said. The car was later found abandoned in Ohlange by the police. However, the men are still at large. He also said the homeowners are shaken but they were not physically injured. On Thursday, a homeowner in Glen Ashley was left traumatised after five men armed with three firearms, posing as construction workers, gained entry into her home, assaulted her and made off with a firearm and electronic equipment.
