Durban - Durban residents living north of the city are facing two service delivery hiccups this week. On their Facebook page, the eThekwini Municipality has alerted residents that there will be a planned power outage in a few areas on Thursday from 8am until 4pm. “There is planned power line maintenance and change of electricity poles, which will affect parts of Norrie Avenue in Virginia, Durban North,” the Facebook post said. The city also apologised for the interruption in service. In another service interruption, the municipality said refuse has not been collected in Verulam, Umhlanga and Mount Edgecombe because of a protest strike at Ottawa Depot which is preventing staff entry into the site. Last month, the municipality made residents aware of a refuse collection disruption in Chatsworth. Areas that were affected included Chatsworth Arena Park, Westcliff and Chatsworth Centre Central Business District. However, areas such as Glenwood and Manor Gardens had not had their refuse collected too. At the time, Tozi Mthethwa, eThekwini Municipality Head of Communications, said the disruption was caused by two compactors being out of commission due to major vehicle breakdowns. Daily News
