Durban - Two KwaZulu-Natal criminals were each given two life terms and 40 years imprisonment for two counts of robbery with aggravating circumstances, kidnapping, murder, rape and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. Siyanda Thwala, 24, and Sdumo Cebekhulu, 30, were convicted and sentenced by the Mthunzini High Court. Captain Nqobile Gwala said in November 2015, the two men entered a shop at Mngampondo area, Eshowe where they found a female shopkeeper. They stabbed her with a knife and took cash at gunpoint and fled. The community tried to chase them but they could not keep up. However, they were able to identify them. “On the following day one of the suspects was seen roaming around in the community, the members of the community alerted the police who responded fast and they apprehended the suspect Siyanda Thwala. He was found in possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition and he was then arrested. After an intensive investigation the investigator managed to arrested the second suspect and they were both charged accordingly,” Gwala said. She said investigations revealed that the two men were linked to other cases at Empangeni where they hijacked Toyota Tazz and killed the driver and locked the passenger in the boot of the vehicle and later raped her repeatedly and left her in a bush. She managed to run away and reported the case at Empangeni SAPS. The ballistic test revealed that the firearm they were caught with it was linked to the Empangeni murder case, armed robbery, kidnapping and rape. This heavy sentence will send a strong message to the criminals and they will know that we won’t hesitate to send them to jail where they belong,” said Major General Bheki Langa, KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner.
