Durban - The families affected by a fire that ripped through
residential flats located above the Merebank Mall, south of Durban, have been relocated to other flats in
the complex. Irshaad Akoob, a shop owner who has been assisting with
relocating the affected families, confirmed the families move. On April 3 the blaze tore through a flat above the Merebank Mall in Natraj Road, Merebank. Five people were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation at the time. “The tenants have been moved over to flats in the same
building and a relief effort is underway to assist them with the items they've lost. These flats were previously vacant and we were in the process of
carrying out minor renovations before the next lot of tenants moved in," Akoob explained. “Three families were affected by the fire, but we moved four
families in total. The fourth family had to be relocated due to smoke damage to
their unit,” he said. Regional Commander for Ethekwini Fire Department, Alfred
Newman, said their investigation into the cause of the fire is still ongoing. “The fire was confined to three apartments. It is suspected
that it started in Flat 131 and then spread to the adjacent apartments. As to the cause of
the fire, this is still under investigation at this stage. Fire crews from Mobeni and Jacobs divisions who were in attendance at the time contained the fire and prevented it from spreading further. ” Daily News
