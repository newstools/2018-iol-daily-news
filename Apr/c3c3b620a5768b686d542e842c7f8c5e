Durban - A 10 year-old primary school boy in Endwedwe, northern KZN, was hospitalised after a botched medical circumcision. The procedure was part of the provincial health department ongoing campaign by the KwaZulu-Natal health department, and thousands of young men have been circumcised over the past few years. The boy’s father, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the minor, said the doctor who attended to his son in Northdale Hospital raised concerns about the manner in which the boy was cut. The boy is was admitted Montebello hospital, and is expected to be transferred to Northdale on Wednesday. “He was first sent to a local clinic before he was transferred to Montebello hospital when his condition deteriorated a few days after he was circumcised. He was then transferred to Northdale hospital in Pietermaritzburg where he was seen by a specialist. We were aware of this campaign as health department officials briefed us before proceeding with the operation. I just don’t understand how this particular person who damaged my child was selected to be part of that team,” the father said. He said he had no issue with the campaigned but it was important to screen whoever was to be part of it. “The doctor who attended to my child said he was badly damaged and that I had to bring him back tomorrow. I’m not happy at all with what I see in my boy, but I’m happy that he is alive,” he said. Isolezwe, the Daily News sister paper reported this morning that the department of education declined to comment. Health department spokesperson Ncumisa Mafunda said the department was attending to the matter and that the boy was receiving attention. Daily News
