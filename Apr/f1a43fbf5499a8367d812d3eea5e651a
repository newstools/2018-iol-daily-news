She arrived in Durban last week and would fly home this week. After separating from her partner of 13 years, with whom she co-owned a restaurant, Pommerel found herself having to start over. She said she had to start at the bottom, so she got a job as a waitress at a pub in Holland. One night, as she was serving a group of men, she overheard one of them speak about travelling through Africa on his motorcycle. “I told the man I wanted to join him on his trip,” Pommerel said. They left Holland on January 6, travelling to Belgium, France, Spain and then finally Morocco. Pommerel knew that South Africa would be her final destination. “I had been to South Africa two times before, and it has always felt like home,” she said. In Morocco, Pommerel went into a restaurant for a glass of whisky, but was instead served the country’s national beverage, known as berber whisky: a cup of tea. “I had forgotten that they do not drink alcohol in Morocco,” she said. As Pommerel made her way through Senegal, Gambia and Mali, people showed her nothing but kindness. “People got so excited when they saw me take off my helmet and figured out that I was a woman,” she said. At Burkina Faso, Pommerel parted ways with her travelling partner who was headed in a different direction. In Ghana, she gave lollipops to officials, to lighten their serious mood. She said Nigeria was extremely hot, and the atmosphere changed because of political issues in the country. In Cameroon, the heat was still bad, but bearable. Travelling through the Congo, Angola and Namibia brought her closer to South Africa. Now that her trip has ended, Pommerel is excited to go back to her three kids: the cats she left behind. If there’s one thing she would like to teach people back in Europe it is to relax and smile more, because African smiles were her favourite sight. Daily News
