A memorial service will beÂ held on Wednesday at 11am at the Hillcrest Presbyterian Church on Old Main Road. Last week Monday Ritchie was in her home when three men stormed in and held her up at gunpoint. Her landlord, who heard her screams for help, rushed to her front door only to be met with a hail of bullets. Luckily none of them hit the landlord who managed to return fire killing one of the robbers and wounding another. The third robber fled. The injured robber is still in the hospital recovering from his wounds.He is under police guard and is expected to make his court appearance when he is discharged. In the cross-fire Ritchie was shot in the stomach. She later died in hospital.
