Durban - A man who bribed his rape victim was handed a life sentence by the Greytown Regional Court in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Bongani Mkhize, 34, was convicted and sentenced for raping a 13-year-old teenage girl in 2017. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, police spokesperson said, “In August 2017, a 13-year-old female was in the company of her younger brother when they were approached by their neighbour who sent her younger brother to get him money from his wife at Mhlangana area, Msinga. As soon as the brother went, the neighbour dragged the female to the bushes, raped and threatened to kill her should she report the incident. He then gave her cash for her to keep her mouth shut about the ordeal.” Mbhele said her mother noticed her daughter behaving unusually and then questioned her. The 13-year-old then told her mother what happened and she reported it to the police. She said Mkhize will also be included in the Sexual Offenders list. Daily News
