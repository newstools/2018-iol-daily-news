Metro Police’s Senior Superintendent Parboo Supersadh said the road had to blocked off in both directions on the M19 Clare Estate, near the Shell Garage.  “The protesters were demanding water and electricity. They took tyres from a vendor who was selling in the area and burned them, blocking off the road.” The M19 had remained closed to traffic for a while due to the disruptions and the clash between police and protesters.  Crisis Medical, who were on scene, said they attended to a man in his 30s who sustained injury when police allegedly fired rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse the crowd.  Authorities cleared the road of debris on Monday afternoon.
