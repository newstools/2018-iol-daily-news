Durban - Police in Ezakheni, northern KwaZulu-Natal recovered dagga weighing 700 kg's with a street value of R1 million. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, police spokesperson said on Monday night, detectives from Ezakheni were conducting an operation tracing  wanted suspects when they stopped a bakkie on the Helpmekaar Road. “The driver of the vehicle was driving suspiciously which lead the officers to believe that the driver of the vehicle was under the influence of alcohol. The vehicle was stopped and on further investigation it was established that the vehicle was laden with bags of dagga. The recovered dagga weighed in at over 700 kg’s and has a street value of R1 000 000,” said Zwane. He said the driver, 35, was alone at the time of the incident and will face a charge of dealing in dagga and appeared in the Ezakheni Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday. He also said the vehicle was impounded. Major General Bheki Langa, The KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, commended the members for the recovery of large amount of dagga. “These operations will continue throughout the province in the fight against drug peddlers,” Langa said. Earlier in the year, Scottburgh police stumbled upon a dagga plantation, with hundreds of dagga trees at various stages of growth. At the time, Zwane said the trees were plucked out by their roots and removed to a dumpsite for destruction. He said most of the trees were ready to be harvested, however, no one was arrested as the plantation was found deep in the bushes. Daily News
