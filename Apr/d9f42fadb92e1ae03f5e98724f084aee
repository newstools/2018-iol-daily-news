Durban - A brewing turf-war over taxi routes and accident scenes in Phoenix, north of the city has claimed the life of a taxi and tow truck boss. Tow truck and minibus taxi owner Malcolm Naidoo,41, was shot multiple times on Monday after gunmen ambushed him outside his friend's home in Sunford Drive. He was rushed to hospital but died on arrival. Joe Naicker, who co-owned Gypsy Towlines with Naidoo claimed that a Phoenix drug lord wanted to wipe out all the independent tow truck owners so he could take over. There are now growing fears of retaliation shootings in the wake of Naidoo's death. According to Naicker, the Phoenix gang using the name Young Money Rich Bloods are allegedly trying to take over the towing areas of Phoenix, uMhlanga and the N2 north to KwaDukuza. They also have minibus taxis in Phoenix. Captain Nqobile Gwala, KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson said police had launched an investigation into the shooting and a breakthrough had already been made. "A 27-year-old was apprehended by police. An unlicensed firearm was also confiscated from the suspect. Charges of murder and possession of an unlicensed firearm are being investigated by Phoenix SAPS," Gwala said. The suspect is expected to appear in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. A funeral service for Naidoo, who was also known as 'Fee' will take place at Bethsaida Ministries in Phoenix on Wednesday. He will be cremated at the Verulam crematorium. Gwala said part of the investigation into the shooting would encompass allegations of a turf war. Daily News
