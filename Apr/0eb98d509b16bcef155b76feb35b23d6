Durban - The SA Post Office has issued a warning over an ongoing parcel delivery scam that has hit several unsuspecting victims. According to the post office, the scammers call people informing them that they have a parcel for collection. But before they collect their parcel they are required to first pay a "customs fees" into a given bank account. “This is not how we work,” said SA Post Office spokesman Johan Kruger. “We do not require customers to make any bank deposit before parcels are released. In instances where there is a SARS levy import tax on parcels from abroad, the import tax must paid at a post office counter when the item is collected. The customer will receive a point-of-sale receipt for this payment.” Kruger said they became aware of the scam after fielding a number of calls on their customer services line from people wanting to confirm that they indeed did have a parcel waiting for them. “So far we’ve received 12 of these queries from across the country, including in KZN. At this stage, we can not say where the scammers got the numbers from, but they obviously have a set of contact numbers which they are working through,” said Kruger. He said where the Post Office has the cellphone number of the recipient, the customer will receive an SMS requesting him or her to collect the parcel at a specific Post Office branch.  The SMS will not request that funds be deposited into an account. Kruger said if people have information regarding this scam, they should report it to the police or the Post Office’s Crime buster Hotline on 0800 020 070. Daily News
