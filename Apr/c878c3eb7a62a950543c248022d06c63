Durban - Members of a controversial business forum have halted construction on the multi-billion Oceans Hotel in uMhlanga developed by billionaire Vivian Reddy. It is believed that behind the invasion was the controversial Delangokubona Business Forum whose members have used mafia-like tactics to stop construction work across Durban demanding a slice of the building contract. However, Thabani Mzulwini, national chairperson of Delangokubona said they were not responsible for the current disruptions at the Oceans Hotel. “People must stop dragging our name through the mud. It is not Delangokubona that is responsible for what is happening at the construction site. It’s the Federation (For Radical Economic Transformation) so they are the right people to speak to,” Mzulwini said. Delangokubona is an affiliate of the Federation. When contacted for comment, Bonga Shongwe, the Federation’s spokesperson said they were still in a closed meeting with the construction company management. The story is developing and would be updated later. Daily News
