Durban - The man who dismembered his sister and nephew was convicted and sentenced by the Mthunzini High Court on Wednesday. Myboy Moses Buthelezi, 45, was sentenced to two life imprisonments for two counts of murder after pleading guilty to both counts. Major General Bheki Langa, KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner said “He received a befitting sentence that will teach and give strong warning to other criminals who want to commit such barbaric crimes. I further commend a team of detectives who work around the clock investigating and tracing the accused after he fled the area for hiding.” Buthelezi had killed, dismembered and buried them in a deep grave in the Esidakeni area near Mandini, along the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal in January. Buthelezi was arrested in March in the Eshowe area, north of KwaZulu-Natal, where he was hiding at Gebhasi Farm. At the time, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, provincial police spokesperson, said police were called to attend to a report about a missing woman and her son at Esidakeni after community members had become suspicious as they had last seen the victims on Tuesday, after an argument with a family member in the house. “While they were at a relative’s house who was last seen with the victims, the (SAPS) members saw a fresh grave and they became suspicious. The members and the community started to dig the said grave and to their surprise, they found the bodies of the two missing people. The body of a woman was chopped into pieces and wrapped in plastic,” explained Zwane. Daily News
