Durban- The Durban High Court precinct was on lockdown on Friday morning as police cordoned of Margaret Mncadi (Victoria) Embankment ahead of former president Jacob Zuma's court appearance. Without the busy peak hour traffic flowing through, the area was serene but for the odd police siren. A large media contingent were hanging around near the road leading to the court. Police Casspirs and a truck with a water cannon used in crowd control took up strategic positions on the road. A truck was parked about 200 meters from the court where a stage is being set up complete with loudspeakers on the side Zuma is expected to address his supporters from the stage once the court proceedings are done. Ten portable toilets are still standing on top of a truck parked on the verge. Low fencing follows the outside perimeter of the court along the pavement. From the flats adjacent the court people gazed out onto the events unfolding as preparations for one of the biggest court proceedings began. In stark contrast to the hive of activity around the precinct, about 30 vagrants slept on the nearby the railway lines under makeshift cardboard houses and plastic sheets, uninterested in the going-ons. South Africa's busiest port Durban continues to operate as normal as dug boats float about while a huge vehicle carrier ship was guided into its berth in the harbour. Daily News
