Durban - The Richards Bay Regional Court convicted and sentenced a 21-year-old man to 15 years imprisonment for rape and attempted murder. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, police spokesperson, said Nkululeko Mdakane approached and attacked a 28-year-old woman living in Richard’s Bay who was on her way back from a local tuck shop in March 2017. “She was approached by the accused who  came out of the bushes and threatened the victim with a knife, demanding money and cellphone,” said Zwane. “The victim told him that she did not have it and he stabbed her and threaten to kill her before raping her. After the incident the victim managed to run away and fortunately she came across a man who helped her and took her to the police station.” He said a case of rape was opened and Mdakane made several court appearances until he was found guilty and sentenced. “He was sentenced to ten years for rape and five years for attempted murder. Sentences will not run concurrently,” he continued. In September 2017, the same court had convicted and sentenced a 35-year-old man to 28 years imprisonment for crimes he committed in Mzingazi, north of KwaZulu-Natal. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, police spokesperson, said: “In December 2011, a couple was accosted by Ntuli whilst they were walking along Richards Bay Main Road in Mzingazi. He chased the boyfriend, threatening him with a knife and grabbed a then 20-year-old victim to the nearest bush where he forcefully raped her. He also robbed the victim of her belongings and cellphone. She managed to flee and reported the matter to the police.” “He was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment for rape and robbery and was given three years for escaping,” Mbhele said. Daily News
