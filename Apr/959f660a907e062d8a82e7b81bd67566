This came after traditional healer Sibonakaliso Mbili promised a reward of R2 million for the head of a white, coloured or Indian woman. Murugan was lured to a sports ground where she was allegedly stabbed about 192 times and her head was severed while she was still alive. Murugan’s sister Jennet said she hoped the sentencing would send a strong message to other people who wanted to commit crime. Daily News
