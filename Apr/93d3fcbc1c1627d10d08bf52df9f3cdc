Durban - The eThekwini Municipality’s Youth Office has planned nine projects with a total of R10 million to develop youth. This was following the tabling of a report which outlined the various youth programmes planned for the city at a full council meeting on Thursday. The report outlined projects from march to June 30 in line with the additional budget adjustment granted to the Youth Development Office in the budget adjustment, said Mandla Nsele, eThekwini Municipality’s Deputy Head of Communications. “The Youth Office has nine projects with a total budget of R10 million to implement the projects,” Nsele said. Nsele said the report states that young people are a major human resource for development and often act as key agents for social change, economic expansion and innovation. “The programme of action has therefore been prepared with the complete understanding that young people must determine their own development trajectory. The report also acknowledged that challenges facing young people are urgent and important with immediate intervention needed to deal with youth challenges,” he said. He said the planned projects include a Young Women Seminar: Life and Times of Albertina Sisulu as well as a Youth Clean-up Campaign launch and ongoing clean-up projects. “A Real Estate (Property Training) for Young People and Young People in Art (talent show) are planned as well as a Youth Walk against Social Ills which also forms part of the programme. A Career Expo and Employment Opportunities Fair is planned for May as is a Youth Mayoral Cup,” he continued. He said in June, an educational beach festival is planned. Daily News
