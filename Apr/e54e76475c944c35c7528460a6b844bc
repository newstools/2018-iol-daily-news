Durban - The Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry anticipates that the nationwide strike has the potential to significantly impact the manufacturing sector. Durban is home to some of the country’s largest manufacturers. In a statement, president of the Chamber, Musa Makhunga, said many manufacturing businesses operate 24-hour production cycles, which would put them at risk considering the movement of employees to and from the workplace. “The Durban Chamber encourages for a consensus to be reached immediately in order to avoid any costs to business. As a result, we encourage businesses and its members to look into their risk management strategies in order to minimize losses on their operations.” Makhunga offered some management guidelines to deal with possible absenteeism. He has advised that management adopt the following guidelines in relation to strike absenteeism:   “We recommend that management adopts this course of action in dealing with any stay-away from work on the 25th of April,” said Makhunga. Wednesday's strike has been arranged by the SA Federation of Trade Unions. It is being called against a range of issues including the recent proposed amendments to the country’s labour laws, including the recent VAT increase, amendments to labour laws and the planned introduction of a minimum wage. SAFTU said while they are not opposed to a national minimum wage, it must be at a rate at which workers can live by and that to pass a law saying this rate should be R20 an hour is unacceptable. They’ve argued that the R20 an hour (R3 500 per month) rate may look attractive when it is calculated over 40 hours a week, but the reality is that the majority of workers do not accumulate that may hours as they are part time or casual staff and end up working less than a 40 hour week. SAFTU is the second largest trade union in the country. Daily News
