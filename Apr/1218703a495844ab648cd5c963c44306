Durban - Three armed men stormed into a dealership in Pinetown, west of Durban, and stole six expensive vehicles this week. Captain Nqobile Gwala, police spokesperson, said security guards were on duty at the car dealership when three men entered and enquired about the vehicles on Sunday night. “The suspects stated that they were from Ladysmith area and wanted to view the cars. Suddenly the suspects produced firearms and at gunpoint assaulted them and removed their cellphones. The suspects thereafter removed six vehicles which contained log books inside and drove off,” Gwala said. She said the Mercedes Benz with no registration plate was later recovered in KwaDabeka after police from the eThekwini Central OCC gave chase. She said the BMW was also recovered in the same area. Blue Security also responded to the scene of the incident and said at the time, they were told five vehicles were stolen. “The suspects fled with three Mercedes Benz vehicles, a BMW and a Ford Eco Sports. No injuries were reported and there were no signs of forced entry onto the the premises,” said Andreas Mathios, Blue Security Community and Media Liaison Officer. Daily News
