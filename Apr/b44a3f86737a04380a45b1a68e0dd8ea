Durban - A debt expert has said an increase in fuel prices and toll fees are going to have a negative impact on the poor. Neil Roets, CEO of Debt Rescue, said coming on top of the 1% VAT increase and generally rising prices, consumers who already collectively owe more than R1,37-trillion in outstanding debt, are going to seriously feel the pinch. Roets said motorists and consumers in general are in for a rough ride. He said the increase will result in high crude oil prices and a weakening of the Rand. “We know from bitter experience that when the fuel price spikes, the cost of pretty much all other goods and service increase as well because of South Africa’s heavy reliance on road transport,” he said. He said he hoped that the government was serious about zero rating more goods and services that were used by the poor to reduce their debt burden. He said many consumers are getting trouble and are compelled to seek relief by going under debt review. “That has become pretty much their last resort to hold on to the few possessions that have not as yet been grabbed by predatory debt collectors,” he said. He said more than half of all South Africans were now three months or more behind in their debt repayments. “We have gone past the point where consumers who aspire to join the ranks of the middle class can dream of achieving that goal. The new aspiration is to put sufficient food on the table to avoid family members going to bed hungry and the latest round of price increases are going to substantially aggravate that situation,” he said.
