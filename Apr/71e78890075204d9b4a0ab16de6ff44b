Durban - The SA Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU) have welcomed judgement and sentences imposed on three men who killed a KwaZulu-Natal school principal in 2013 - but they believe the case is not closed yet. SADTU Provincial Secretary Nomarashiya Caluza said 9 May  2013 will never be forgotten in the history of the union. It was on this day that (then) 46-year-old Nkosinathi Zondi was gunned down at his home in Umlazi as he prepared to make his way to Nyonemhlophe Primary School in Umtwalume (where he worked). On Thursday Umboso Makhoba (37), Andile Zulu (36) and Sandile Mzisi (36) all received life sentences for their part in Nkosinathi’s murder. Makhoba had three months added to his sentence for theft, relating to a grass cutter that he stole from the property. The two were alleged to have been the hired guns in the hit for which they were paid R12 000. Mzisi -  who was also a member of the school governing body at Nyonemhlophe Primary School - was alleged to have been the facilitator for the hit. Caluza said SADTU had always put their trust in the justice system and remained positive that Zondi’s killers would be brought to book. “But the problem remains that those who ordered the hit have not been revealed. So we are calling for further investigation into Comrade Zondi’s murder. We believe those who gave the mandate for this hit are still out there and we want them brought to justice too,” she said.
