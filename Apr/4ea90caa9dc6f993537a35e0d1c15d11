Durban - Do dog owners who love taking their dogs to the beach know that eThekwini has a lot of dog friendly beaches? Provided the dogs are on leashes at all times. The eThekwini Municipality has taken to Facebook to alert residents on which beaches are dog friendly. Dog friendly beaches but on a leash:   However, some Facebook users had a lot to say about dog friendly beaches: Kevin Button: I wonder why then, in December we were told by lifeguards that uShaka beach (to the harbour entrance) was a non-dog friendly beach?? Why now suddenly is that a dog on leash beach. We have been running dogs off leash for years. Cornelia Viljoen: My poor old pug was attack 3 weeks ago by a leash-lessÂ staffie that is "friendly." was a terrible experience. That was at brighton beach Sally FitzGerald: Most of these beaches are quite remote. People are nervous to take the dogs there Fiona Campbell: The sad part is how few beaches there are for dogs. Let's be honest standing in poo versus a rusty fishing hook, broken bottles or needles it's waaaaay better. But hey people get more beaches to ruin and destroy. Sad really. Margaret Nel: Please remember to bring the leash and doo-doo bag. Daily News
