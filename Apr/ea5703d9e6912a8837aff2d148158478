Durban - A video doing the round on social media of a shop in a mall being attacked by a group of men is fake. Along with the video, people are saying the shop is in City View (Game City), in Durban. However, a Daily News reporter took a walk inside City View and none of the shops were damaged. Most of the shops at City View were still closed. The reporter also spoke to a security guard who said none of the shops were attacked by strikers.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

The reporter also met a shopper who showed her the same video and the shopper said he was told that the shop that was attacked was Game in Davenport Square. However, there is no Game store in Davenport Square. Instead, they found that there are many theories surrounding the video footage on social media. Some people are saying the video was taken in 2017 while others are saying the video was taken in a mall in Mthatha and it was a Game liquor store that was attacked. The South African Police Service has warned strikers to behave accordingly during the strike by the South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU). Daily News
