Durban - Planning for the building of a new government hospital in Mbumbulu is well underway, and KwaZulu-Natal health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo said this was an issue that was beyond doubt. Speaking shortly after briefing amakhosi (chief) at a meeting held at Mbumbulu on the KZN South Coast on Monday, Dhlomo said that although construction of the new hospital was still in the planning stage, it would ultimately bring a significant improvement to the lives of an estimated 1,4 million-strong population from areas such as Adams, Mfume, Nhlazuka, Mbumbulu, Folweni, and others. Currently, people in the areas get medical attention from Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital. “It will be remembered that when former President Jacob Zuma visited this area four years ago, he indicated that people in Mbumbulu were raising the hospital matter very sharply. We have Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital that is big enough to support Umlazi. But areas such as Adams, Mfume, Nhlazuka, Mbumbulu, Folweni - that’s about 1,4 million people - do not have a hospital. Getting a strong instruction from Amakhosi to come forward with a report on this matter is something that I take seriously. Even though we have constraints, I had to come back and give a report of where we are in terms of this process. The hospital is very necessary because it is very far to move from Mfume, Ilovu, coming into Prince Mshiyeni and finding long queues because there are many patients there. It is a matter of priority that we must look into a hospital in and around Mbumbulu,” Dhlomo said in a statement. He said he would look at the department’s financial affairs, and also establish from Premier Willies Mchunu on where the new hospital project stood. “At yesterday’s meeting, I promised amakhosi that I will report back to them soon in this regard. I wish to emphasize, however, that [the building of the new hospital] will not happen tomorrow,” he said. Daily News
