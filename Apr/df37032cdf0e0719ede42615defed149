Durban - The Durban and Coast Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) in Durban has warned that 99 percent of animals die from Distemper, a disease similar to rabies. The association said vaccinations and prevention are important in combating Distemper. “Distemper is a highly contagious viral disease. They usually have a nose and eye discharge and coughing. Later signs are twitching on head or forelimbs, having fits and weakness in the hind legs. If these are present then euthanasia is the only option. It is not a new disease, it is one of the oldest diseases that has been around. Having your dog vaccinated every year is the only way of ensuring that your dog will not contract the disease. It’s all about prevention!” said Tanya Fleischer, Marketing Manager at Durban and Coast SPCA. Some of the symptoms associated with Distemper are fever, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhoea, discharge from eyes and nose, coughing and muscle tremors in the body and the head. The SPCA also said the disease resembles rabies. The dog can also suffer from weakness, seizures, disorientation, loss of appetite and aggression. The SPCA urged owners to take dogs with these symptoms to the vet immediately. Daily News
