Durban - An alleged house robber was shot dead and two others were wounded in Pinetown on Monday night when a homeowner, responding to his neighbour's cries for help opened fire on a gang terrorising her. During the drama, a 72-year-old woman was shot by the alleged robbers. Unconfirmed reports are that three men entered the house in Padfield Park carrying firearms. The woman who lives alone as a tenant was the alleged target of the robbery. The owner next door heard the noises and came outside.
