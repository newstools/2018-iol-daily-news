Durban- A private ambulance service in Durban is planning to lay a criminal complaint against the Metro Police after one of their crews had their vehicle searched and were taken to the police station where they were allegedly interrogated by metro police officers. Garrith Jamieson, Operations Director of Rescue Care, said his paramedics were held for "no conceivable reason", forced to go to the police station and had their phone confiscated on Wednesday. "Our primary focus is the preservation of life and our business is conducted in line with all relevant legislation and within the ambit of the law," he said. Jamieson said his ambulance was stationed in the south Durban region when they became aware of an accident in Isipingo. "We need to cut down response times in the event of an emergency, vehicles in our fleet are deployed strategically. In this case, the ambulance was near a tow truck. The driver of the tow truck informed our medics that there had been an accident and, worrying about the well-being of those involved, our staff responded to the scene," Jamieson said. "The paramedics arrived to find that the accident had in fact been staged by members of the eThekwini Metro Police and officials from Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) as part of what we understand was an unauthorised operation," he claimed. Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, Metro Police spokesperson, said there was a sting operation after a request from ICASA to Metro police. Sewpersad said no official complaint has come through to Metro police from the ambulance service. Jamieson said his attorneys have now proceeded with registering criminal cases of; contravention of section 28 of the criminal procedure act [unlawful search], kidnapping, unauthorised borrowing, cybercrime, crimen injuria and impersonating a police officer against the officials.
