Durban - The man who raped a six-year-old girl from Eshowe, north of Durban was handed a life sentence by the Eshowe Regional Court. Thulani Milton Shandu, 34, had raped the six-year-old at Ntumeni, outside Eshowe, said Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, police spokesperson. “It is alleged that the children were playing at the homestead yard at Ntumeni area, Eshowe when their mother called them for lunch. Other children responded to the mother and the victim did not turn up for calling. The mother checked around and saw her coming out from the mielie plantation. When the mother inquired as where she was, she started crying and she told her mother that she was taken away by the neighbour uncle to the mielie plantation and raped her,” explained Mbhele. She said that after several court appearances, bail was successfully opposed and Shandu remained in custody until he was found guilty and sentenced. Major General Bheki Langa, KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, welcomed the sentence handed down. “This is the fitting punishment given to the accused who was expected to protect a child from the enemies. This will send a strong message to the would-be rapists who intend to abuse women and children in the province. Our specialised units will make sure that those involved are getting hefty punishment,” Langa said. Daily News
