Durban- Patrolling police officers swooped on three alleged robbers moments they were about to commit a crime in Overport on Tuesday night, Constables Tyron Colbeck and Lusanda Dlamini, who are based at the Mayville police station, were on routine patrol in the Overport suburb when they noticed a green Ford Fiesta travelling at a slow speed in West Road. Upon noticing the police van the driver increased his speed and drove through side roads in an effort to evade the police. Captain Nqobile Gwala, KwaZulu Natal police spokesperson said police followed them closely and tactically pulled them over in traffic along Felix Dlamini (Brickfield) Road. "The three men in the car had no chance to escape," Gwala said. "They were searched. Police found an unlicensed firearm with the serial number filed off, a woollen beanie and gloves. The arrested suspects aged between 20 and 27 will appear in the Durban Magistrates’ Court for possession of an unlicensed firearm today," she said. In a separate incident north of Durban, a motorist was hijacked of his Audi A3 when he stopped at the Salt Rock offramp. Gwala said the victim was at the off-ramp when the hijacker punched his right cheek with a gun. "He noticed another man opening the passenger door. The victim submitted by raising his hands in the air and proceeded slowly out of the car.  The hijackers opened the boot. The victim got off the car and fled the scene. The hijackers drove off with his white Audi," she said. A case of car-jacking was opened at Umhlali police station for investigation. Ismail Mitha, Emergency Control SA chairperson, said he is always impressed with the response from social media Whatsapp groups. Mitha said the vehicle was last seen heading on the R614 near oThongati. "I put the message out to Be On the Look Out for the car. A farm worker spotted the car parked off near some bushes and notified emergency control. The car was taken to the police station," he said. Daily News
