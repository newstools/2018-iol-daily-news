“Whenever we’d spend time together, I’d just prepare myself for his questions. ‘How’s your grades, Mom?’, ‘How’s your study schedule going?’ It’s been very hard for me working and travelling, but he’s been a great support,” said Mkhonta, national director of SOS Children’s Villages in Swaziland. Mkhonta graduated yesterday with a Doctorate in Education, while Hlophe was awarded his Bachelor of Social Sciences degree on Monday. The family are originally from Swaziland. “I’ve been studying part-time from Swaziland because my work keeps me very busy. Sizwe stayed at UKZN full-time, but we’re able to see each other over the holidays. We’d always encourage each other, but I think he encouraged me more . “I waited too long to do this PhD. I started it when Sizwe had just finished high school. My biggest challenge has been financial because of my own fees and his. This was a dream of ours and it’s come true.” The pair are among more than 9000 students graduating at UKZN in ceremonies running until April 24. Daily News
