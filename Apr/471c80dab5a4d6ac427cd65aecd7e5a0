Durban - Thirty-five pupils were suspended at a Ladysmith school following a fight that resulted in the hospitalisation of one of the pupils. The fight broke out between two groups on the school’s assembly area. Knives were brandished and stones flew between the two groups. A source said the school governing body intervened and suspended the 35 learners after reporting the incident to the district office of the department. Kwazi Mthethwa, the provincial education spokesperson, said the South African Schools Act provides that pupils cannot just be suspended unless a learner is posed a danger to fellow pupil in the school. He said in some districts including Uthukela, faction fights within communities tend to spill over to schools. “We understand that this is a societal matter and we are and have appealed to traditional authorities to take a leading role in resolving whatever issues exist within their communities. The district (Uthukela) office is handling the matter and they will submit a report to the department,” Mthethwa said. In a separate incident, a 17-year-old Durban school learner was stabbed to death about 100 meters from the school. The Daily News reported on Thursday that Skhumbuzo Gumede died outside Intshisekelo High School in Inanda early this week. It is alleged that he was stabbed by another learner on his way to school for calling out the names of some learners who had not done their school work the previous day. Daily News
