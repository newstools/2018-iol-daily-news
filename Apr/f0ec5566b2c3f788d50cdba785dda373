Durban - Two KwaZulu-Natal fathers were convicted and sentenced for raping their daughters in two separate incidents. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, police spokesperson, said that the Empangeni Regional Court convicted and sentenced a 40-year-old father to 20 years imprisonment for raping his daughter. “In November 2017, a 13-year-old female was sleeping at her home in Nseleni township when her father came to her room, forcefully took her to his room where he raped her. She managed to run away and seek assistance from the neighbor. The matter was reported to the police and a case of rape was opened,” Mbhele said. In another incident, a 35-year-old man was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment by the Pinetown Regional Court for raping his then 14-year-old daughter. “In September 2015, the victim, her nine-year-old sister and their uncle were renting a house in KwaDabeka township with their father. The father forcefully raped his daughter in front of the younger daughter and threatened to kill her should she report what had happened. The accused also chased his brother out of the house to prevent him from finding out about his horrendous deeds. The younger sister persuaded the victim to report the incident and they went to the neighbor who helped them to go to the police station,” she said. Daily News
