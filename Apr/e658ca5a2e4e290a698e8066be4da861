“We want to discuss how they can better liaise with metro police and SAPS before they come out to disconnect us, so that we can avoid these kinds of protests,” said Manser Akoo, chairman of the Community Policing Forum for Clare Estate and surrounding areas. “These kinds of protests have become a reality across the country, but we need to look at how better planning can see police on standby every time disconnections are planned in volatile areas,” he said. eThekwini officials could not say whether they informed the police before heading out to volatile areas. They asked that an e-mail query be sent for “all the relevant departments to be consulted”. Chaos erupted on the M19 on Monday afternoon when residents of a nearby informal settlement stole tyres from a used-tyre vendor along the road and burned them, blocking off the road in both directions. Metro police spokesman Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersadh said SAPS and metro police officials were called in. Crisis Medical said they attended to a man in his 30s who was hurt during a clash between police and protesters. Meanwhile Denis Sokhilingam, whose home is across the road from one of the settlements, said: “It affects us in all directions. Residents from different settlements protest in different key roads. It is an ongoing problem and the root cause is that people have no access to basic services. Yes, the illegal connections are a problem, but there are too many people without basic services. “If the authorities could simply address the water, electricity and sanitation needs in these communities... They need services and so do we. Let’s improve the quality of life for these residents,” he said. Daily News
