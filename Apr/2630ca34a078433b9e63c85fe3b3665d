Durban - The decomposed body of the policeman who went missing after his state vehicle got washed away while trying to cross a low-lying bridge in Vryheid was recovered on Tuesday morning. Warrant Officer Arnesh Juggan, his wife Molly and his friend Ashoak Rajoo were in a police van driving towards Vryheid from Dundee when the vehicle was swept by heavy current while trying to cross the overflowing Buffalo River between the two northern KZN towns. It took the police nine days to recover the van with Molly trapped inside. Today, the tenth day of the search, the police recovered Juggan’s body on the banks of the same river. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said search and rescue teams from around KwaZulu-Natal were involved in the search for the Dundee policeman and two civilians. He said an inquest will be opened and that any speculation about where they were going, or why the two civilians were in the state vehicle will be investigated. “One person is now still missing and we thank all who were involved in the search. All the search units around the province including the K-9, local community including farmers got involved in the search. We thank the one farmer who even used his aircraft to assist in the search,” Zwane said. The search is still on to find Rajoo. Juggan’s son, Sajiv declined to comment referring the reporter to the police. Daily News
