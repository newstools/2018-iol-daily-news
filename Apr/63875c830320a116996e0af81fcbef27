Durban - Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) has raised awareness on the dangers of unattended livestock on KZN roads. Prem Balram, Rusa spokesperson, said members of Rusa have attended to many calls from residents in two Verulam residential areas, complaining of cattle that were causing obstructions and near collisions. “Reaction Officers responded to separate call-outs in the Brindavan and Oaklands area and 22 cattle were found. No herd-man were found & no one has claimed ownership of the animals. Reaction Officers have made several attempts to find the owner with negative results,” said Balram. A week ago, Rusa responded to a scene after a driver was killed and two people were left injured when the bakkie they were travelling in knocked a cow on the south bound lane of the R102 between Canelands and King Shaka International Airport intersection. “The driver suffered life threatening injuries and died on scene while his wife was seriously injured. A second passenger was also injured. Medics from the Provincial Ambulance Service as well as a private ambulance service stabilised the injured on scene before transporting them to hospital,” he said. He said it is alleged the occupants of the bakkie were on their way to do a bakery delivery when he knocked into a cow. The bakkie then veered from the south lane across to the north lane before crashing into an embankment. He also said the cow was also killed in the incident. Daily News
