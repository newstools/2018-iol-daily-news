Durban - The eThekwini’s Engineering Unit’s Coastal, Stormwater and Catchment Management (CSCM) Department has closed four Durban beaches for sand pumping operations. Portions of North Beach, Dairy Beach, Country Club and Battery Beach were closed on Friday to allow for sand pumping operation which will likely take four weeks. “Beach replenishment at these locations will be undertaken through an offshore system. Sand and water samples will be taken to test for water and sand quality. This emergency sand replenishment process is a joint operation between the city and Transnet has been approved by the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs,” said a statement issued by the eThekwini Municipality’s Communications Unit. The statement also said that during the sand pumping, bathing and beach use will not be allowed in the closed off areas. Randeer Kasserchun, Coastal, Stormwater and Catchment Management deputy head, said sand from south of the harbour is dredged and transferred to Durban central beaches through sand pumping operations. He said the city prides itself with the maintenance of the beaches and it is important that they are nourished. He said there is a shortage of sand on the beaches that will be closed for sand replenishment. “If sand is not pumped onto the identified beaches, they may have to be closed for bathing as the safety of bathers will be at risk,” Kasserchun said. The city has urged beachgoers to be patient during this process and to comply with restrictions which have been temporarily prescribed. Daily News
