Durban - Three men were injured after a wall collapsed on them in Pietermaritzburg on Tuesday. ER24 paramedics responded to the scene of the incident where three men were left injured at a construction site on Ross Close Road in Eastwood on the outskirts of Pietermaritzburg after a wall fell on top of them. Russel Meiring, ER24 spokesperson said when paramedics arrived, they found that three men had already been pulled out from under the rubble by their co-workers. “It is alleged that the men had been working on the wall before it collapsed,” Meiring said. “Paramedics assessed the men and found that two had sustained moderate injuries while a third man had sustained serious injuries,” he said. He said the men were treated for their injuries and the seriously injured man was given medication and they were transported to Northdale Provincial Hospital and Mediclinic Pietermaritzburg for further treatment. He also said details surrounding the incident are unknown. In Johannesburg, an abandoned building partially collapsed in the city centre, killing three children on Monday afternoon. The children were aged three, five and 10. Three weeks ago, three people were killed after part of a building collapsed on construction workers in Wentworth, south of Durban. The incident also left at least five workers seriously injured. Daily News
