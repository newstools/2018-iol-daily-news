Durban - The N3 Toll Concession has issued a warning that there was a protest taking place in Mooi Plaza in the early hours of Monday morning. The protest left two trucks burning on the N3, northbound and one truck burning on the R103 and R622, this according to the Protection Services Chief in Mpofana. Reports also suggest that stones are being thrown at cars and tyres are being burnt. The N3 Toll Concession had issued this warning on their Twitter page at 5.10am and said traffic flow may be interrupted and motorists may experience delays. However, later the situation became worse and the N3 Toll Concession alerted road users that the road is totally closed. In addition, they asked motorists to delay their trips and urged them to be very cautious. According to a Facebook post by the Public Service News Network KwaZulu Natal, motorists can use alternative routes. “Alternatively go to Stanger, head towards Greytown, on towards Muden, Colenso, Ladysmith and back onto the N3,” said the post.
