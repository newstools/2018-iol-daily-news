His sister, Laurelle Kock Jones, said he had been admitted to hospital earlier this month. The family are still making funeral arrangements. Due to complications caused by his weight, Kock underwent an operation to remove excess fat in 2013. A year earlier he had lost weight after taking up a weight loss challenge in aid of charity. He had also undergone hip replacement surgery recently. Gareth Coskey, a close friend, said Kock was a legend to many people and was among the best MCs and entertainers. Coskey said he was SA cricket’s best fan. Before he became ill, he had raised money for many charities and was most noted for losing weight in support of the Sunflower Fund. Kock, a father of two, also donned a Santa Claus suit at malls to entertain children. “He had such a bubbly, jovial personality. He made our variety shows in Newlands East awesome. The heavens are smiling to be receiving such a legend,” Coskey said. People took to his Facebook page to send messages of condolence. Marina Taylor posted: “what a character what a legend”. Christelle Naidoo said: “A picture that I took of him will remain in my head till the end. I remember the excitement it brought him when I hooked him up with WhatsAapp and took the pic for his status. Will miss you, Minister of Entertainment.” Jeanette Wybrow posted: “He was an icon of our land. Gone far too young but never ever forgotten.” Charles Staals said: “An end to a magical era and what awesome memories filled with fun and laughter in your own words. I thank God for bringing you into all of our lives farewell brother.” Daily News
