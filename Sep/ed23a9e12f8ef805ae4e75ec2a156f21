Durban - Port Shepstone police have uncovered a major theft syndicate with stolen items linked to Pinetown incidents. Lieutenant Colonel Zwane, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said Sawoti police recovered a stolen vehicle in their area on Tuesday afternoon. He said members were conducting their crime prevention duties when they saw a suspicious-looking Toyota Corolla vehicle stripped in private premises. "Police circulated the said vehicle and it came as a stolen vehicle from Ellis Road in the Malvern area. A case of theft of a motor vehicle was opened at Malvern police station," Zwane said. Police also found items linked to a case of fraud that was opened at Pinetown police station. Zwane said a person had opened an account at a store using false documentation.  He said police are continuing with investigations on Wednesday to make arrests. Police said there were vehicle parts scattered everywhere on the property. Police searched nearby houses and found a quad bike, power tools, chainsaws, contraband cigarettes and handbags. A source said police were still sifting through items they had found and thus far have linked some of the items to cases in Pinetown.  Police believe it could have been a syndicate targetting the Pinetown suburb.
