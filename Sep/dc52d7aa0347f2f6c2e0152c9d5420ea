According to Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, 148 rhinos were poached in KZN in 2016. In 2017, it was 202, and 88 were poached so far this year. As environmental agencies continue their efforts to fight rhino poachers, scientists from Hemmersbach Rhino Force have been building the largest biobank for rhino genetics - the Cryovault, mainly using frozen sperm and oocytes (cells from rhino ovaries). “The ultimate goal is to apply frozen semen in all artificial insemination trials,” explained Dr Imke Lüders, a researcher at Cryovault. Cryovault has two locations in South Africa - one in Hoedspruit, Limpopo, and another on a private rhino breeder’s farm near Klerksdorp in North West. Lüders, a German specialist in zoological medicine, said as part of their research they had performed artificial insemination on cats and were also working on other species, such as rhino and elephant. “Artificial insemination has been successfully performed with fresh and frozen semen in white and Indian rhino already. The biggest challenge is the correct timing; we need to know when the female is in heat (oestrus) in order to transfer the sperm.” She said they had been collecting sperm from rhino in de-horning procedures but also from carcasses, including those that had been poached and after a post-mortem was conducted. “This is to ensure genetic diversity, since we lose it with every poached animal. “Natural breeding is still the best option, but in some cases assisted reproduction may be an option to promote genetics,” Lüders pointed out.
