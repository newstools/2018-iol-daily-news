Durban- A gang of thieves who were allegedly stealing goods trucks from the back of stationary trucks in Durban were released on bail. Three members of the gang made an appearance at the Durban Magistrates Court on Monday. Simphiwe Motaung, 37, Sipho Jila, 37 and the man owning the Hyundai H1 kombi's  Patrick Mkhize, 58 were released on bail of R2000 each. Police are still trying to track the remainder of the gang. The men were arrested in connection with the theft of boxes of body lotions from a truck in Umgeni Road. Colonel Thembeka  Mbele said the trucks are parked near warehouse receiving depots waiting for the stores to open to deliver goods. The truck drivers are in the cab of the truck while the theft occurs. The gang were allegedly caught on CCTV footage removing the tarpaulin sales off the side of the truck outside Arrow Cash and Carry Umgeni Road recently. They then grabbed boxes stacked on a pallet inside and loaded them into the kombi. "One man was in possession of a firearm. The suspects loaded the goods into their vehicle and drove away. A case of robbery was opened at Durban Central," Mbele said. Daily News
