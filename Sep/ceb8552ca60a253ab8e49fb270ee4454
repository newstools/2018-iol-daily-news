Thami Ngidi, Mchunu’s spokesperson, said the report was then officially submitted to the provincial legislature on August 28. “The premier still has 21 days to go through the document and give his input. Members of the legislature have already given him their views and he has no intention of taking the 21 days before releasing the report. He wants to implement it as soon as possible because it would not make sense to commission a report and not implement the findings and recommendations,” Ngidi said. The commission was established by Mchunu in October 2016 to investigate the underlying causes of political killings in KwaZulu-Natal, and it concluded its work earlier this year. The latest politically-related killing in the province happened in May when Sifiso Cele, an ANC branch treasurer, was gunned down on the Lower South Coast. It was reported that his death brought the number of ANC members killed in the province to 24 since 2016. According to evidence presented at the commission, more than 80 politically-related killings were recorded in the province since 2011. The Right2Know campaign cautioned against delaying the release of the report as it could be the key to solving murders believed to have political undertones in the province. Last month, the group filed a Promotion of Access to Information Act application requesting transcripts of the report from the premier’s office, but to no avail. Group spokesperson Mluleki Marongo yesterday said: “We’re playing the waiting game, but at least they acknowledged receipt of our application. “It must not be forgotten that killings are continuing and this report might be the key to putting an end to this.”
