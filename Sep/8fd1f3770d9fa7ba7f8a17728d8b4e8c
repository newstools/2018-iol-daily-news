Durban - A man who allegedly opened a false case of hijacking to police appeared in court for defeating the ends of justice. Police spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said Wiseman Nxumalo, 32,  had reported to police that he had been hijacked of his Toyota Tazz along uMhlanga Rocks Drive recently. "He alleged that he was approached by three armed men who robbed him of his vehicle. A case of hijacking was opened at the Durban North police station. Detectives began their investigation in earnest and the victim was questioned thoroughly with regards to the incident," Zwane said. During the course of the investigation, evidence was gathered by police detectives. "It became blatantly apparent that the man was not hijacked but had opened a false case with the police. He was confronted with regards to the discrepancies and was charged for defeating the ends of justice," Zwane added. Nxumalo appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court on Monday. The case was remanded until 25 September 2018 for further investigation. Police have noted with great concern that there are still too many people who report false cases at the police stations. Zwane said police resources are wasted when police respond and investigate these false cases. "This has resulted in investigating officers adopting a firm stance against this type of behaviour," he said. Daily News
