Durban - Burnt rubble and ashes from the material are still occupying the premises of Jini Trading Factory which was razed to the ground by a fire in August. Residents living nearby have complained to the local ward councillor Aubrey Snyman regarding the health risk they are exposed to on a daily basis. The factory occupies Gavin Road in Jacobs. The factory has been using the road to store bales of material. The factory manufactures shoes. On Wednesday, bales of leather, rubber and plastic caught alight emitting intense heat and thick black smoke over Jacobs, Montclair and eManzimtoi. Mandla Nsele, eThekwini municipality spokesperson, said the cause of the fire is undetermined as yet. "Various city departments were also in attendance. A report will be compiled once the work at the site is completed. No health issues emanating from the smoke have been reported.” Nsele said. The fire was contained to the top floor and firefighters prevented fire spread to the rest of the premises. Nsele said the factory was in operation when the fire occurred, about 20 employees were on site and escaped unharmed. Snyman said he was waiting for the report to be compiled and in the interim, the owner is cleaning inside the building but the area remained a mess in Gavin Road. Daily News
