Durban - Police have taken the national deputy chairperson of People Against Petrol and Parrafin Price Increases (Papppi) to the Durban North police station after a protest on the M4 on Friday. Durban Metro police spokesperson Parboo Sewpersad said the protest was illegal because Papppi had not made a formal application to the police. "About 50 people stood on the roadside of the M4 between Blue Lagoon and Swapo Road offramp. Some stood in front of the cars causing traffic to come to a standstill. This caused severe traffic congestion. They have broken several by-laws," Sewpersad said. Visvin Reddy, Papppi spokesperson said,  they demand justice and condemn police brutality. Reddy who is outside the police station demands he be released. "We began a peaceful protest on the M4. These were trumped up false charges. He is held at the police station. Even the police do not understand the plight of our people suffering under these high fuel price increases. The police use private vehicles. The cause affects every one of us. It is unacceptable," Reddy said. A video clip of the arrest taken by bystanders shows about three to four police officers grab hold of a man with a white T-shirt with the  Papppi logo on it. A policeman keeps telling him he is under arrest while trying to grab hold of the man. About five officers surround him as they attempt to take him away from the roadside. These include policewoman. The man is still clutching on to a placard. Daily News
