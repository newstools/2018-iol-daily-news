Durban - A group of residents renting in an informal settlement in Reservoirs Hills is demand housing. About 20 residents took to the streets on Thursday morning blockading Battersea Avenue and Mountbatten Drive with rubble and tree branches. The settlement has grown over the years inside the Pridley Road park between houses. Ish Prahladh,  Reservoir Hills Ratepayers association spokesperson, said the residents demanded that a road must be built to the informal settlement. "It is a very contentious issue and we are not sure what stirred it up. From what we gathered they were not happy renting from shack lords. They demanded a meeting with the councillor and when they could not reach him decided to blockade the road," he said. Prahladh added that residents had to use an alternative route out of the area. "They also set a list of demands which they handed to the councillor. One of them is for houses to be built for them on the site. There is a meeting going to take place to resolve the matter," Prahladh said. Daily News
