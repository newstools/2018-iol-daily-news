In its second year, the event takes participants in and around the Kings Park precinct, including through the Sharks’ changerooms and the tunnel, leading walkers and runners out on to the field of dreams where many of the world’s best rugby players and musicians have performed over the years. The Santa Run is not a race, but a fun experience open to everyone, young and old, and is possible thanks to its partners - The Kid Zone, The Hub, East Coast Radio, the Sharks and the Daily News. Along the route, one can expect several interactive activities including inflatables, tunnels of lights and a water table as well as experience the historic back avenues and areas of this world-famous stadium. A free kids’ zone will be available, as well as a pop-up craft market, music, interaction with children’s characters and much more, including a snow machine over the finish line. “At The Hub, we pride ourselves on offering exceptional value fashion and homeware for the entire family, and so we are thrilled to be partnered with the Santa Run to get Durban and KZN families out to the Home of the Sharks to officially kick-start their holiday season and festivities with this fun-filled event,” said Loshnee Bridgmohan, The Hub’s marketing executive. “Thekidzone.co.za is all about fun and making sure that we deliver a smile to every little customer, every time. Being part of the Santa Run for the second year allows us to do what we do best - bring smiles to the entire family on a day filled with fun, laughter and great excitement,” said chief executive Raygen Magiera. Tickets are available at Web-Tickets at an early bird price of R100. It includes a free R50 gift voucher, a Christmas hat, a Christmas cracker and all other free activities.
