Sadia had been seated in her father’s car, which was parked in her grandmother’s driveway, when the vehicle was taken. It is alleged that her father fired at the vehicle before it crashed into a truck. Sadia died in a nearby hospital. A firearm belonging to Sadia’s father, Pastor Shailendra Sukhraj, was sent for testing as it was the only gun recovered from the scene. A report had been given to prosecutors in the case against Sibonelo Mkhize the only suspect charged with the murder. When Mkhize appeared briefly in court again yesterday, the matter was adjourned again for DNA analysis. According to people close to the case, DNA analysis on a piece of evidence is hoped to crack the case. However, it could take up to six months for the analysis to be done, although the hope was that the laboratory in Pretoria would fast-track this sample. A source told the Daily News that the DNA evidence was expected to confirm the ballistic findings and what the investigation team already knew. Although prosecutors had confirmed receipt of the ballistic report, and that they knew the findings and who fired the fatal shot, they said the results were being kept secret for the purposes of the ongoing investigation.
