Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, the metro police spokesperson, said roadblocks were held within the city and also in the outlying areas. “Although the rain put a damper on some of the roadblocks, we still conducted (them) under bridges and arrested at least 120 drunken drivers,” Sewpersad said. “If you want to drink and enjoy yourself, yes you can, but you must bring along a designated driver or use the services of public transport or Uber to take you home,” he said. Sewpersad said some of the arrested drivers had already appeared in court for a bail hearing, while others would appear in court today. He said they had also conducted warrant roadblocks. “We also had an undercover drug operation by our Special Projects Unit attached to our Multi Operational Response Team,” he said. They arrested a 52-year-old man from Seaview for dealing drugs. “He was arrested on Saturday with 96 capsules of heroin with a street value of R1920, and two pieces of rock cocaine with a street value of R200.” Sewpersad commended all the police officers who worked tirelessly in the recovery of drugs and arrest of criminals. He said there were many Johannesburg tourists along the beachfront, from Blue Lagoon all the way to the Point. “Some of them arrived on Friday afternoon and they were still partying yesterday (Sunday) and today (Monday) on the beachfront,” he said.
