Durban - Security was heightened at city hall after some members of the Metro police attempted to storm the building and disrupt the executive council meeting on Tuesday. The city hall’s Pixley ka Seme (West) Street entrance was locked and whoever needed to leave the building had to use alternate exits including the library. The bone of contention was the reinstatement of three Metro police members who were dismissed early this month. It is not clear why the members were dismissed. Sbonelo Mchunu, SA Municipal Workers’ Union regional chairperson, said the stand-off was an attempt by the members to have the dismissed members reinstated. “The issue here is that when one is dismissed there’s an appeal process to follow. I’ve heard that another issue was about councillors being guarded by Metro police and some by other law enforcement agencies. Councillors are free to be guarded by whoever they want but the police have a mandate to protect all citizens of the city,” Mchunu said. Metro police spokesperson Parboo Sewpersad said the officers who tried to storm the city hall wanted to do all the VIP duties. “I understand that even some councillors are divided on this issue. Some are happy to be guarded by Metro police while others prefer to be guarded by municipal security. With regards to the dismissed officers, I’m made to understand that they did not follow the appeal process, instead they went straight to politicians for their intervention,” he said. Daily News
