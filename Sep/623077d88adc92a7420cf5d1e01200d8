Durban - Robbers who have been dubbed the knockers gang have struck again in the Musgrave area on Tuesday. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said a 62-year-old man was on the way to deposit money into a bank situated in Clifton Place, Musgrave at 10:30 am. "He was accosted by a suspect brandishing a firearm.Â  The suspect then grabbed a bag from the man with an unknown amount of cash and fled the scene," Gwala said. A case of robbery has been opened for investigation at Berea SAPS. The gang, so named because of their modus operandi which involves targeting bank customers after they leave the premises, has still not struck fear into people. The gang also often follows people to the banks and rob them of their cash. With numerous incidents of this nature, Police are still baffled as to how the gang gets information on who is carrying large amounts of cash. Daily News
