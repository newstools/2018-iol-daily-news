Durban - An 84-year-old Pinetown man was tied up with his belt in his home by a robber on Tuesday night. The pensioner who is still in shock according to Pinetown Neighbourhood Watch members lived on Blenheim Road, Farningham Ridge. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KwaZulu Natal police spokesperson, said the victim was with his wife watching TV when an unknown man forced the window open and entered the house just after 10pm. "The suspect tied the complainant with a belt and robbed them of cellphones and jewellery before fleeing the scene on foot," Gwala said. The neighbourhood watch said the suspect climbed over the barbed wire fencing to the property and then used a brick to break the window pane which did not have a burglar guard. His wife was also leftÂ traumatised by the incident. A case of robbery was opened at Pinetown police station for investigation. Gwala said no arrests had been made. Daily News
