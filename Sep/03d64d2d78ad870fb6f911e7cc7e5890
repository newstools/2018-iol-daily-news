Durban - A burglar who police are saying could be one of Durban's dumbest criminals left behind a picture himself while he was fleeing a home in Morningside. According to KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala, when the owner of the house returned at 2 pm on Monday she noticed that a burglar gate was forced open and her laptop was missing. The local neighbourhood watch said two men had come through a back alley and removed a piece of the palisade fencing below the electric fencing wires in the backyard of a home in Claribel Road. The men slid underneath and entered the house through a bathroom window. Neighbours told the Daily News that they screamed when they heard shuffling noises. This interrupted the burglars who were loading their loot for a getaway. In their haste to escape, a neighbour said the men all tried to get through the hole in the fence at the same time. The tight squeeze caused one of the men to leave behind a slipper, a green cap and a Nike takkie. A photograph of what could be a possible suspect and items stolen from the home were found nearby. Earlier the suspects had allegedly tried to steal a bicycle from another home in the area but were disturbed. Police are investigating the incident. Daily News
