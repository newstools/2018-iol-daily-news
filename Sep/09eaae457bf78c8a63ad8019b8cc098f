Durban- Kessie Nair, the man who gained national notoriety this week for calling president Cyril Ramaphosa the K-word is expected to appear in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi, the national spokesperson for the Hawks, know as the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigations said NairÂ was arrested late on Wednesday. "Following the video clip that went viral on social platforms on Wednesday with derogatory/provocative utterances against the president of RSA a case of crimen injuria and inciting public violence was opened in Phoenix against a known perpetrator," Mulaudzi said. "He was immediately arrested and charged to appear before the Phoenix Magistrate's Court. Further charges are expected to be added when the accused makes his first appearance. Brandon Pillay, a former eThekwini councillor and Chatsworth community activist, said he had opened a charge against Nair on Tuesday. Pillay said he read some derogatory remarks made by Nair on Facebook as was taken aback. "While absorbing his defamatory words and slander Nair then went the extra mile by posting a video clip. I felt he had to be dealt with. It is wrong. The public should know that Nair`s statements and utterances do not express the views and opinions of the Indian community," Pillay said. Daily News
