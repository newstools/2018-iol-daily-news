Durban - The Umbilo licensing office will remain closed for another week after a bomb went off in the office on Tuesday. The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Transport (DOT) informed members of the public, particularly in the eThekwini Municipality that the licensing offices situated in Stellawood Road will be temporarily closed until next week Friday. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a group of ten men forced their way into the licensing centre and held up security guards. "It is alleged that the suspects used an explosive unit to open a safe. It has not yet been established what they took from the safe. Police are investigating a case of robbery," she said. Mluleki Mtungwa, a DOT spokesperson, said the bomb caused extensive damage to infrastructure. Hundreds of people were turned away from the offices, since Tuesday, after robbers allegedly bombed the cash safe at the premises. "While repairs are being conducted, members of the public can obtain the Department’s services at the Motor Licensing office in Morningside, corner of Smiso Nkwanyane and uMngeni Road or any Post Office around eThekwini. The Department would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused to members of the public,"Mtungwa said. Daily News
