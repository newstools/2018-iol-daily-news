Durban - Colleagues of Constable Abdul Yusuf are praying for him after he was shot during a business robbery in Avoca, north of Durban on Wednesday night. Yusuf, who is based at the Sydenham SAPS detective branch, was off-duty when he went to fetch a family member from a shop in Avoca. It is alleged that while he was inside the shop three robbers had entered the store. According to Marshall Security spokesperson, Kyle van Reenen, Yusuf was shot twice; once in the chest and a second time in his left arm. Van Reenen said a scuffle had broken out between the policeman and armed suspects. The three robbers entered the premises pretending to be customers. “When we arrived at the scene, it was ascertained that during the scuffle, an armed suspect fired shots, striking the victim who fell to the floor. Emergency teams worked fervently to stabilise the man, using several advanced and intermediate life support interventions, before he was placed onto a mechanical ventilator to assist him in breathing,” he said. The injured man was rushed to a nearby hospital for further care. Van Reenen said police attended to the scene and would be investigating further. Meanwhile, the gang managed to flee with approximately R10 000 in cash. Greenwood Park police are investigating a case of business robbery. Daily News
