Durban - Child safety rules were on top of the list to discuss when police visited schools in the south Durban community of Wentworth this week. Brighton Beach and Wentworth police stations and their Victim Friendly Facilities joined forces to host a safer schools roads show. Captain Louise Le Roux, Brighton Beach police spokesperson said child trafficking and kidnapping is a concern in South Africa. She said children are our most vulnerable groups in communities, falling prey to those with criminal intentions. Colourful homemade teaching aids, with cartoon characters, were created Le Roux to enhance children’s learning experience, during presentations. She facilitated the risks children are exposed to on a daily basis when travelling to and from school, and when visiting public places. Captain Lolipop, a mascot, also accompanied police on the roadshow. "The safety of children is the responsibility of parents, guardian, caregivers, communities, faith-based organizations, educational institutes and the police.  Through continuous conditioning of child safety rules to children, we together can minimize the risk of children being taken," Le Roux said. Six senior primary schools have been visited within the Wentworth policing precinct.  Over 4 600 learners and 127 educators have attended the 12 presentations held to date.  The remaining six senior primary schools will be visited upon commencement of the next academic term Daily News
