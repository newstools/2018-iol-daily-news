And while Blue and Marshall security companies do not dispute the numbers, they believe there has been little decrease in this type of crime at local level. According to the SAPS crime stats, hijackings had decreased to 16325 cases in 2017/18 from 16717 in 2016/17. In KwaZulu-Natal, there were 3029 cases in 2016/17, which decreased to 2698 in 2017/18. Retired medical professor Dr Soornarain Subramoney Naidoo was hijacked in Bayview in October last year. He was assaulted, bundled into the back seat of his Mercedes-Benz at gunpoint and driven to uMlazi, before being dumped in the township’s W section. “The SAPS, the police minister and his generals are all living in some kind of utopia if they think there is a decrease in hijackings. Every day we see video clips on social media of hijackings that are happening,” he said. Naidoo said he was still waiting for the police to contact him for an identikit of his hijackers, who removed their balaclavas inside the car. “I found the KZN police to have been thoroughly inefficient in handling this case.” He said the trauma of his ordeal had not abated and he still had flashbacks of the day. Kyle van Reenen of Marshall Security said they had not seen a decrease in hijackings in their areas. “We partner with car tracking companies and work as a recovery agent for vehicles, and hijackings are still a concern for us. Vehicles are still being stolen; maybe not as much as before.” Andreas Mathios of Blue Security said: “Even though the police have reported a decrease, we encourage people to continue to remain vigilant when leaving and entering their homes.” Daily News
