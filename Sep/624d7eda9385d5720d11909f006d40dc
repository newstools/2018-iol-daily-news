The off-duty Phumlani Mbatha was struck when Nolwazi Nzimande sped through a red traffic light. Nzimande, who was convicted of culpable homicide, allegedly continued driving with his body on the roof until dropping it off on Silverton Road. Her defence had been that she panicked when she thought she was being hijacked, but was not aware that she had hit a man. A witness wrote about the incident on Facebook, which helped the police to arrest Nzimande when the car was spotted by officers while being towed to a panel beater - apparently to hide the evidence. Magistrate Simphiwe Hlophe said Nzimande had not shown remorse. He sentenced her to five years in jail, suspended for five years, and house arrest for three years, although she would be able to go to work. She was ordered her to do 16 hours of community service a month, and to refrain from any intoxicating substances. He also imposed a R3000 fine or six months in prison for defeating the ends of justice, and R5000 or 12months for failing to report the accident. Nzimande’s driving licence was suspended. She was also ordered to write a letter of apology to Mbatha’s family, and to enter a victim/offender dialogue to try and heal wounds for the officer’s family. However, Nonhlanhla Mbatha, the officer’s mother said she was not interested in an apology. “This girl had more than five years to apologise to me, but she didn’t.” Daily News
