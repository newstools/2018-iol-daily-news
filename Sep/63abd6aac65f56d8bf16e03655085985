Durban -  A Reservoir Hills woman is still in shock after a stray bullet struck her BMW windscreen during a drug turf war in Sydenham on Monday night. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said the woman alleged that she was at the Rippon Road and Dr R.D.Naidoo Drive intersection waiting for the signal to change when she heard a loud bang. "She noticed that her windscreen was cracked and there was a shooting in progress. She drove off and reported the matter to the police. A case of attempted murder was opened at Sydenham police station for investigation," Gwala said. Moments earlier, Gwala said police had responded to a  complaint of a shooting at Sydenham Heights on Rippon Road. "On arrival at the said place unknown suspects opened fire at the police before fleeing the scene. No injuries were sustained by the police. No arrests were made. The motive for the shooting is unknown," Gwala said. According to residents, there has been a drug turf war between a group of men in Matlock Grove and Sydenham Heights A-block on Rippon Road. The 32-year-old woman had been returning from a meeting and was heading towards Clare Estate. Her father, who spoke to the Daily News under conditions of anonymity, said his daughter was shocked but mustered up the courage to drive to the nearest petrol station on Clare Road where she called him from. "She was caught in a shootout between police and criminals. We are in the process of replacing the windscreen. She was traumitised but she has calmed down. When we got to the police station last night police had informed us of what happened," he said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
