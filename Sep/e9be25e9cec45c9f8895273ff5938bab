Durban - Police are investigating who was behind the burning of tyres on the N3 freeway Durban bound near Spaghetti Junction on Friday - in what could possibly be linked to fuel protests around the city. Early on Friday, tyres were placed on the busy freeway disrupting the flow of traffic. Durban Metro Police spokesman Parboo Sewpersad said there was also a protest with regard to the petrol price increases in the country taking place on the M4 freeway in Durban North. Sewpersad said police had cleared the roads and traffic was flowing as normal. Visvin Reddy,People Against Petrol and Parrafin Price Increases (Papppi) , said in a video posted on Facebook that they planned for a shut down of Durban on Friday from 4 am to 10 am. "Unfortunately we have underestimated the anger of the people against the fuel price increases. This morning many of them began burning tyres in key roads leading into the city. We understand the frustration of South African's but we do not condone any act that will endanger the lives of innocent people," he said. Reddy also said that the burning of tyres on the road is counterproductive and endangers the lives of innocent people. He said after demonstrating on the M4, Papppi will go to the Durban Central police station to lay criminal charges against the former minister of energy Tina Joemat-Petterson for the illegal sale of strategic fuel reserves. "We cannot sit back and do nothing while fuel prices are expected to go up next week by over a rand a litre," Reddy said. Daily News
