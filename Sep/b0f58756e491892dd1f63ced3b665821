Durban - Police are warning the public not to carry large amounts of cash because they become easy targets for criminals. Despite these warnings, said Colonel Thembeka Mbele a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, some business people still conduct cash transactions or physically deposit large amounts of cash into banks putting them at risk. The warning comes after yet another businessman was robbed after collecting a large amount of money. On Monday a man went to collect cash from a business on Devonshire Road in Glenwood when he was robbed at gunpoint. Mbele said when the man got into his car, he was approached by an unknown suspect who grabbed his bag. "The bag contained an undisclosed amount of cash. The suspect fled the scene in his getaway white VW Polo. A case of robbery was opened at Umbilo SAPS," Mbele said.
