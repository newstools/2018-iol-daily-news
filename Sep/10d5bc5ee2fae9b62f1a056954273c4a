Durban - A truck driver has entered his name into the record books after being caught travelling at 136 km/h by the Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) in KwaZulu Natal on Tuesday. Zinhle Mngomezulu, RTI spokesperson said officers were conducting speed timing using laser cameras on the N3 northbound carriageway near Ashburton when they recorded the speed. "The driver had a combination truck which means he had a horse and two trailers. He was stopped by Pietermaritzburg RTI officers. He had been charged and was granted bail of R2 500 at the Alexandra Police station. The 33-year-old Zimbabwean National hadÂ not paid his bail yet," she said. He faces charges of reckless and negligent driving. Mngomezulu said the truck was travelling from Mpumalanga to the Durban Harbour. He also had a spare driver in the truck at the time. She said this was the highest speed recorded in the truck category.      Mngomezulu said in the past six months they arrested a truck driver for travelling at 124 km/ h on the N3. "Drivers should know that excessive speed kills. We do not expect trucks that are laden with goods to be driven at such speeds. How would the driver have reacted if there was an emergency? Both vehicle and truck drivers are warned not to break the law," she said. Robert Mckenzie, KZN Emergency Medical Services spokesperson, said this is said to be the highest speed and arrest for a truck in 18 years. He commended the officers at RTI in Pietermaritzburg for a job well done. Daily News
