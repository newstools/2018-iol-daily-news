Durban - A moment of silence and a short prayer was said for nine-year-old Miguel Louw at his school, Rippon Primary on Tuesday following the discovery of the body of a young boy in Phoenix on Monday. The family of Miguel were expected to visit the Phoenix mortuary to identify the body that was found in a shallow grave on Longbury Drive. There was a sombre mood at the Rippon Primary School where Miguel attended. The school convened a special assembly to inform the pupils that until there was confirmation from Miguel's family, he was still just missing. The school held a moment of silence and said a short prayer. The school had to briefly explain to children the process that is involved in identifying a body and the need not to panic. The school principal K.D.Mbatha referred all queries to the Department of Education in KZN.  The staff were instructed by the department not to speak to the media. Posters of Miguel were pasted on walls and notice boards throughout the school, bearing silent testimony to the seven-week search for the missing boy. There were different versions of the missing person's posters and some of them were coloured in to highlight the words "Please help find Miguel Louw", presumably by children in the school. A staff meeting was also convened and teachers involved in the search for Miguel were very emotional. Inside the classroom, Miguel's desk and chair remained empty among the 43 other pupils. The teachers and pupils had hoped that he would return to fill the seat. Daily News
