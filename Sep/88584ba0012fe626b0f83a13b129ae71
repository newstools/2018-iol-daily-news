“We need to capture the hearts and minds of our youth,” said Carla Geyser, environmentalist, humanitarian and founder of the NPO the Blue Sky Society Trust. Two weeks from now, Geyser and an all-female crew will embark on an expedition from Johannesburg to Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia before heading back to Botswana. “I’m a little nervous and excited about the journey There are some logistics I am still working on ahead of the day: we leave on September 16. “These include sorting out insurance, making sure our satellite phones work, finalising the routes and watching the news for any political activity in some countries, because we don’t want to walk into riots.” She said the main focus along the journey’s 9000km route would be creating awareness of wildlife. “We lose elephants and rhino daily because of poaching,” she said. Funds raised by the expedition would benefit Elephants Alive (South Africa), the Rare and Endangered Species Trust (Namibia), the Eco-Exist Project (Botswana) and the Soft Foot Alliance Trust (Zimbabwe). Geyser said that while in Botswana they would spend time with the Chobe Angels, an all-female team of game rangers. “There is an incredible women’s movement going on around the world, empowering women,and we want to showcase this,” she said. Geyser said their last stop back in South Africa would be near the Kruger National Park, where they would spend time with the all-female anti-poaching unit the Black Mambas. “While the expedition is about wildlife conservation, it is also meant to inspire other women,” she said. Geyser encouraged people to follow their journey on social media @Blue Sky Society Trust, where they can find out how to pledge and donate to the cause.
