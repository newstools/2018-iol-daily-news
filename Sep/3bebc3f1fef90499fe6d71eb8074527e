Applications closed last Friday, and all the candidates have since gone through background and criminal checks. Sewpersad said some of the 207 short-listed candidates from last year, who were expected to begin work soon, may have to be cut from the force due to disciplinary hearings and crimes including theft committed while undergoing training. The eThekwini Municipality's human resource department has already gone through 35000 CVs. Last year, the municipality's first intake in almost 10 years resulted in more than 40000 applications being received for 207 positions. The 2017 recruits are expected to hit the streets in the next two months and will be the new wave of Bobby-On-The-Beat officers the city is introducing. However, the recruits could be reduced as some were arrested for crimes such as shoplifting and theft while going through Metro Police training. Others, said Sewpersad, were being disciplined for altercations with their instructors and some were being taken to task for arriving late for training. “If you want to join the Metro Police, you have to be disciplined,” Sewpersad said. Shortlisted candidates will be called to go through a further round of selection comprising physical fitness tests, aptitude tests and interviews. Sewpersad said all candidates would go through numerous background checks. Daily News
