Durban -  Police are hunting for two men who pepper-sprayed a Durban metro policeman and robbed him in Verulam on Wednesday. Durban Metro police spokesperson, Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, said a 60-year-old policeman, based at the Verulam Metro police base, had booked off-duty and was on his way home when he decided to visit a relative in the Canelands area. "While he was leaving the place a man approached him and sprayed pepper spray on his face. This blinded him. They both got into a scuffle but the man overpowered the policeman. His firearm was pulled out from his holster. His bakkie and cellphone were also stolen," Sewpersad said. The men fled with his silver Isuzu bakkie towards KwaDukuza. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said he was seated in his bakkie along Vincent Dickenson Road in Verulam when the robbery took place. Gwala said he was accosted by two suspects. "At gunpoint the suspects robbed him of his vehicle, service pistol and cellphone before fleeing the crime scene in his Isuzu LDV. Charges of carjacking and robbery were opened at Verulam police station," Gwala said. Sewpersad described the policeman as a dedicated person who has been with the police service for 35 years. Sewpersad appealed to the community to come forward with information on the whereabouts of the bakkie and suspects by calling 10111 or 031 367 0067. Daily News
