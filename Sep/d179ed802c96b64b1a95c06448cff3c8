Durban- A Newlands East teenager has done KwaZulu Natal proud after picking up first prize in the South African National Gymnastics Championships. Liam Randall, of the Durban North Gymnastics Club, had won his provincial rounds and went on to compete in the national finals in Gauteng. Liam,15, a grade 10 pupil of Hillview Secoundary School, has been involved in gymnastics from the age of six said his elated mother Robyn Firmin Randall. "He has won various accolades since he took up gymnastics. He was very hyperactive and we decided to enrol him in a sport. I think he was born to be a gymnast. He also won the African championships held in Namibia in 2017," Randall explained. Liam won four gold and two silver medals and was placed 1st overall in the Level 4 SA National Champs last Saturday. The Durban North Gymnastics Club Facebook page stated that Liam won the Class 4 event with great composure and Andy Flynn finished second in the highly competitive JO section, winning Floor and P bar along the way. The club wrote that it was a proud moment for KZN. Lucrecia Joanne Ryan, aÂ resident, said Randall made the community of Newlands East proud. Daily News
