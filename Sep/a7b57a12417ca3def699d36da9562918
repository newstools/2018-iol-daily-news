Durban - MTN announced on Saturday that it would be pulling the plug on ‘Free Twitter’ from September 25, leading tweeps to suffer a Twitter meltdown. In a tweet on Saturday morning, the telecommunications giants said they would be pulling the plug on the free service after four years. The telecommunications literally buried the issue when they tweeted: “May its soul live forever in your memes and GIFs #RIPFreeTwitter”.      On Twitter, influencers and ordinary tweeps had their say, with some roasting the telecommunications for the short notice.        via GIPHY                         A spoof accounting posing as the police said they would be prosecuting MTN, gaining more than 1 000 retweets.
