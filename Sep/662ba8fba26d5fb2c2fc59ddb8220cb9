Durban - A Phoenix man who tried to sell his parents television for drugs was expected to appear in the Phoenix Magistrates Court on Monday. Annastashia Naidu, a spokesperson for a private security company Platinum Asset protection, said the man was arrested on Thursday in Shastri Park Drive. Naidu said their response officer was on patrol when he saw two men carrying a flat screen television and walking towards a shortcut to Mandela Park, Zwelisha in Phoenix. "Both men fled in different directions when the response vehicle stopped. After a 15-minute chase on foot one of the men was caught and questioned," she said. The man allegedly told the officer that the television belonged to someone in Central Park and that he was taking it for repairs. "Central Park area is on a caller response program with Platinum and was immediately contacted to confirm the situation. The client had informed us that the TV was actually taken without permission. The TV was about to be sold for drugs," Naidu claimed. Phoenix police station had registered a case of theft. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KwaZulu Natal police spokesperson, said a 20-year-old suspect was arrested and charged for theft after he was caught with a television set in his possession. She said the results of his court appearance results are unknown at this stage. Daily News
