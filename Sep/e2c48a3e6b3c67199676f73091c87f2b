A medal parade was expected to take place at the Air Force Base in Durban today. Seven people will receive the Forty Year Good Service Medal and 87 the Thirty Year Good Service Medal. Brigadier General Mafi Mgobhozi, SANDF spokesperson, said many medals were being presented because of a backlog. One of the people receiving a medal was senior pioneer Swelindawo Shoba, 68, who worked for the SANDF for 46 years. Shoba retired in 2004 without receiving his 40-year service medal.  “I’m very happy that I’m getting it. My heart was sore that I could work so many years and not get my medal. If I died without getting it, I would have died with a broken heart. “I’m very happy that I’m getting it and I’m thankful to the SANDF that I’m here today,” Shoba said. He was born in Bulwer, Underberg, and has four children and many grandchildren. He joined because he he needed a job. It turned out he would spend most of his life with the SANDF. “I did a lot of things and ended up as a driver. I even got licenses to drive the big cars. I drove in convoys,” he said. Warrant Officer Trevalene Frazer, 52, has spent 34 years at the SANDF and is eligible for a 30-years-of-service medal. Frazer is from the Bluff. She is married, with three children and six grandchildren.  She works for the South African Military Health Services and is the case manager for KZN. “When I was in school the SANDF did a career planning day. They took us to the navy and I was very excited. I said this is where I want to be and this is what I’ll be, a warrant officer until I retire. That was my goal and I did that. “I went through basic training when I was 16 years old, turned 17 in the military and I’ve been there ever since. This is the only job I’ve ever had,” Frazer said. She said that when she first joined, everything was in Afrikaans. She would have to go back to the camp with her books, translate into English, study and then write in Afrikaans. Daily News
