Durban - Durban mayor, Zandile Gumede, has appealed to Community Policing Forums to continue the work that they are doing in the community. She said CPFs must continue to fight crime. Gumede was speaking at the Provincial Indaba hosted in Durban yesterday. The indaba was organised by Transport, Community Safety and Liaison MEC, Mxolisi Kaunda. Gumede noted the murder of KwaNdengezi community leader, Thulani Nxumalo last month. "He was also leading the CPF in the area," she said. Gumede said it was sad to see those, who are protecting our communities, were being killed. "I encourage those who are leading CPF not to be scared and continue to fight crime in communities. Instead of losing hope, we must be inspired by his death and continue with our fight against crime. We hope that Police will make arrests in his case," Gumede said. Nxumalo was also chairperson of the ANC branch in the KwaNdengezi area. Daily News
