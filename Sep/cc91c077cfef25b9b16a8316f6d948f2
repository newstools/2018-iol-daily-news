Durban - Durban University of Technology management called a meeting with the Student Representative Council to thrash out issues that saw classes being disrupted on Monday. Striking students disrupted lectures and tests at the Durban University of Technology campuses on Monday in protest of some students not being given their meal allowances - knowns as SBUX. This followed a  graphic shared on social media calling for #ShutDownDut. Hundreds of students were forced out of their classrooms as a small group wearing EFF regalia walked from the ML Sultan Campus into the Ritson Campus. The Student Representative Council said they had a sit down meeting with the management concerning the issues being faced by students at Durban University of Technology a week ago but their concerns were not addressed. The students have three grievances that they tabled which included student meal allowances known as SBUX. Alan Khan, a DUT spokesperson, said DUT management did not know the reasons for the protest until the Vice-Chancellor and Principal of DUT Professor Thandwa Mthembu, received a memorandum with a list of demands from the SRC. "A meeting has been scheduled with the SRC for midday today to discuss the issues that were raised in their memorandum. The campus has not been shut down. University operations continue and classes are on the go, despite some of the disruptions this morning," Khan said. Public Order Policing had to be called in after students began walking through the campus intimidating non-striking students. Daily News
