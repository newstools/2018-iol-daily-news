Sibongiseni Sigcawu’s defence that he could not remember shooting Sicelumusa “Sce” Thusi in May last year had puzzled Judge Johan Ploos van Amstel. The judge repeatedly questioned him over how it was possible to shoot Sigcawu 16 times and not remember, although he could remember being at the prison tavern where the incident happened. Thusi, an employee at a trucking company in Durban, had been visiting a relative, who was also a warder at the prison, when he was shot and killed. Sigcawu told the Durban High Court last week that on the day of the incident, he went to his house on the prison premises after work. He left his service pistol behind and picked up his private weapon before leaving. He told the court he always carried his private pistol. State advocate Katija Essack called for life imprisonment. Essack said it was shocking that Sigcawu committed the offence inside the prison and while in uniform. Ploos Van Amstel said the State could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was premeditated. “There is no proof that the shooting was planned,” he said in pronouncing sentence. Daily News
