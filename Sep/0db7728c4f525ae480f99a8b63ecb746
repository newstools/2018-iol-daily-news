Durban - It was an emotional day for the police officers of Hillcrest SAPS for the "September is Police safety month" event. On Thursday, officers from the Hillcrest SAPS paid tribute to their colleagues who died on duty. They had a walk through from the corner of Old Main, Stonewall Road and Inanda Road holding a canvass banner with all the handprints of the members of Hillcrest police station printed on it. Steven King, South African Community Crime Watch (SACCW) KZN coordinator,  said Police handed out flyers to bring about awareness of police killings. "This year we have lost a lot of brothers and sisters in blue and we hope that this event brings some awareness to our community. Police officers dedicate their lives daily to protect and serve.  This is a  display of unity to show their commitment to the SAPS," King said. The SACCW also paid tribute and acknowledged the role the SAPS plays in protecting people on a daily basis. "Despite the criticism which they endure on a daily basis they still muster the strength and courage to serve and protect. We would like to say thank you to CAPI Security who sponsored all the hand paint and brushes as well as Sharpline for donating the framed Canvas, "King said. Daily News
