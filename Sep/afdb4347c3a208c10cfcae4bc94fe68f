Durban - Police are on the hunt for three men who pretended to be policemen by flashing fake badges before they robbed a Clare Estate family. Colonel Thembeka Mbele, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said that on Friday night the victim was at his place of residence in Palmiet Road, with his wife,  when they heard a knock on the door. "Upon opening the door the victim was then confronted by three unidentified men. The men drew guns and forced the couple inside the house. At gunpoint the men robbed them of cash, clothing and a handbag. The suspects fled the crime scene on foot.  No arrests have been and none of the stolen items was recovered," Mbele said. The Clare Estate Community Policing Forum said the men were dressed in civilian clothing but flashed ID badges with the police insignia on it. A case of house robbery is being investigated by Sydenham SAPS. Daily News
