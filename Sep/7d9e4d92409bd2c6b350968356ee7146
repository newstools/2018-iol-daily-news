Durban - The KwaZulu-Natal north coast continues to attract property investors from across the country, many of whom are "semigrating" -  setting up primary residence in one province and commuting weekly to another province for work or business. According to the developers of the multi-billion rand, Zimbali Coastal Resort investors are increasingly quitting the hustle and bustle of city life and are living in one province and working in another. Adriaan van Schoor, Vice-President of Sales, IFA Hotels& Resorts explains said the current demographics of Zimbali owners bear testament to the rise of ‘semigration’. "About 60-70% of our owners hail from Gauteng and have made the choice to set up their primary residence in Zimbali. Therefore, it is not surprising that there has been a sharp rise in the number of families moving to the North Coast and the number of estate property transfers over the last year,” van Schoor said. “One cannot think that the two (the North Coast population increase and the increase in the number of transfers in gated estates) are mutually exclusive- over 50% of the transfers which have taken place in the same period are in gated estates, injecting a whopping R1.4 billion into the local economy. Families from other provinces are swopping the crazy commute and rushed lifestyle for the benefits of life on the coast- sunshine, the sea, warm climate, top schools and life in a premium gated estate,” he said. Recent statistics also reveal that KZN north coast is not only attracting newer, younger buyers but is managing to retain current property owners as well. Half of these new buyers are under 35, indicating that the area is attracting a new type of investor. Situated just a few kilometres South of Ballito city centre, Zimbali Coastal Resort is hailed as one of South Africa’s,  top three estates. Daily News
