Durban - The eThekwini Municipality has scooped an international award in the WWF’s 2018 One Planet City Challenge held in San Francisco, California recently. About 132 cities representing 23 countries participated in the challenge and eThekwini Municipality was named as a national winner in the national category. "Clearly, what we are doing here at home is getting recognised elsewhere. We must not be discouraged by voices that oppose or criticise us, we must continue and improve," Mayor Zandile Gumede said in her opening statement at the executive meeting sitting at the city hall on Wednesday. She said she was also glad to learn that Durban was also listed as the fifth wealthiest city in Africa according to  AfrAsia Bank’s 2018 Africa Wealth Report which found that wealth held in eThekwini totalled $55 billion. Gumede said this should be redistributed for the benefit of all people. "On Friday, we will be hosting CEOs as part of our customer relations drive. We are creating a platform for engagements on how we can better collaborate to make the vision of being Africa’s most liveable and a caring City by 2030 a reality. We want to take customer service to another level, in fact, we are moving towards relationship management," she said. Gumede welcomed the recently released Moerane Commission report. The commission was appointed to look into the cause of political killings and how best these could be prevented. She called on the city's security cluster, city manager Sipho Nzuza, legal unit, human settlement, office of the speaker and mayor should study the report and advise the council properly. "This is an important report and we must not let it slide because we have also witnessed the killing of key political leaders. These include our ANC regional secretary Sbu Sibiya, Cllr Zodwa Sibiya, Cllr Mshibe, Glebelands hostel killings, KwaMashu hostel killings KwaXimba ward 4 areas," she said. Daily News
