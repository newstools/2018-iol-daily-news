Durban - Phoenix residents who live on the border of a notorious drug den known as the "Barnyard" have applauded the police for raiding the place on Wednesday. The drug den situated in Rucklen Place has been a sight for sore eyes for many of the residents who watch drug addicts queue up to buy their fix from a makeshift shack on the property where poultry was once sold. Colonel Thembeka Mbele, a KwaZulu Natal police spokesperson, said police officers, arrested two men aged 25 and 36 in possession of 2050 heroine capsules, 60 mandrax tablets and five pieces of rock cocaine.
