The report highlighted several of the country’s achievements. “The tone and inflection of media and other reporting and activist commentary became predominantly negative - often with good reason,” said Kelebogile Leepile, IRR’s media and public affairs officer. “But we became concerned that balance was being lost and that, amidst their fears and frustrations, South Africans would believe they had failed at what so many people had bravely set out to do in 1994.” According to the report, inflation dropped from 9% in 1994 to 5.3% in 2017. Economist Professor Bonke Dumisa agreed there was an improvement. He said the inflation range was in a good region as it was not above 6%, and was not too small as it was not below 3%. “An inflation rate that is too low is not good as is the case with Japan and the US, which are struggling with very low inflation which has affected business. The current inflation rate is good for low-income groups,” he said. Although South Africa still has a high unemployment rate of 27.2%, the number of black people with jobs increased from 4.9 million in 1994 to more than 12 million in 2017. The upward mobility of black people within the workspace was also another statistic that changed significantly since the advent of democracy. The report found that the number of black employees in top management or executive positions was at 8% in 1996 and increased to 37% in 2016, with a peak of 41% in 2015. The number of people going to university had also increased. The report found that in 1985 there were 211756 students enrolled at university, which increased nearly fourfold in 2015 to 824880 students. There was also an improvement on the crime front. The report stated there were 25965 murders in 1994/1995 compared to 19016 in 2016/2017. Reacting to the report, Bobby Peek, the director of groundWork - a non-profit environmental justice and developmental organisation - said South Africa had created good laws since 1994. “However, the challenge is the implementation of these laws,” Peek said. Professor Ashwin Desai of the University of Johannesburg said the country was at a crucial point. He said the 20-year mark was a very important time as the country faced numerous challenges. Desai said Parliament had also become more vigilant as a watchdog. “In that sense, we are on the right path,” Desai said. Daily News
