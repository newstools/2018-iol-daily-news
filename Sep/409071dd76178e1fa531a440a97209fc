Durban - Paramedics helped deliver a healthy baby boy at the back of a bakkie at the St Augustines Hospital in Durban on Monday. Shawn Herbst, Netcare 911 Limited media liaison officer, said St Augustine's staff heard shouts help coming from their parking lot.  When staff responded they found Nontuthzelo Bhengu in the back of a bakkie in severe pain and in the process of delivering her baby. "While one of the medics Preshan Harrilal reassured both the mother and father Philani Bhengu medics fetched their medical equipment in preparation for a delivery. After a short period, little Sibusisiwe Nkazimulo Bhengu was welcomed into the world to big smiles from his parents," Herbst said. Both parents and their baby, said Herbst, were then transported to the closest emergency department where mother and baby were assessed by the doctor. The baby was given a clean bill of health. Herbst congratulated the staff members. Daily News
