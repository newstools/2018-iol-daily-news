Durban - A UKZN graduate has looked at the lives of 20 women living on the streets in Pietermaritzburg and how they survive for her research project. Dr Lungile Zondi, graduated with her PhD in Anthropology for research that delved into the life and experiences of young women between the ages of 19-35, living on the streets of the Pietermaritzburg CBD and surroundings. According to Zondi’s study which sampled 20 women, she looked at various reason as to why these women lived on the streets. There were various factors including whoonga addiction, forced /arranged/early-marriages, corporal punishment, grandmother and big brother headed families, family connections on the street, as well as hereditary recurrences, have led to women living on the streets. Her study also found that these women possess obscured and misconstrued identities that ccomewith living on the street and they actively use fending strategies for survival. Fending strategies include hourly prostitution, standing on the road intersections and working as car-guards during the day and night. Zondi argues that the women’s vulnerability context includes being treated less than human, smuggling whoonga, unpaid prostitution, assault by law enforcement authorities and the death of their friends while sleeping. Despite such challenges, the study finds that the women are sceptical about being reunited with their families. Zondi, who is a member of staff at UKZN, thanked her family, friends and supervisor, Professor Vivian Besem-Ojong, for being her support system during her studies. Daily News
