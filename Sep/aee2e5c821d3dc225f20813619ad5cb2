According to the SA National Blood Service (SANBS), this is the most important group because it is compatible with others and is donated to everyone. “SANBS is appealing for South Africans to make a donation of blood today,” said Sifiso Khoza, SANBS regional marketing manager. “More than that, however, the SANBS appeals to South Africans to become regular donors. By donating blood only four times a year, we can easily avoid situations such as the one we find ourselves in,” he said. Mbali Blose, 16, was diagnosed with aplastic anaemia when she was in Grade5 and was told she would need blood transfusions regularly. “The doctors told me that they didn’t think I would live for more than five days if I didn’t get a blood transfusion urgently,” Mbali said. She said her body could not generate its own cells. “If I don’t receive regular blood transfusions, I feel as though I will never make it through the week.” Khoza said KwaZulu-Natal only needed 500 units of blood per day. “However, we are experiencing difficulty achieving this,” he said, adding that the province aimed to maintain a stock level of five days, with 3000 units collected nationally daily to meet demand. “So many people in life-threatening situations require blood. It’s what saves that haemorrhaging mother’s life, it’s what saves someone suffering complications during surgery,” he said. Nationally, there is currently a 0.1day stock of platelets, important in blood-clotting. The blood is processed through a cell separator, which retains the platelets and returns other blood components to the donor. This procedure enables people to donate platelets every month in a process that takes about 90 minutes. Daily News
