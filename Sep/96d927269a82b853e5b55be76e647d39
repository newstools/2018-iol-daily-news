“After (Sibongiseni Sigcawu) was arrested, he was granted bail. We were never in court for that. In fact, we didn’t know about that court appearance. We have had three investigating officers handle this case,” said Mandla Thusi, Sicelumusa “Sce” Thusi’s older brother. Sce had been visiting his brother-in-law, a warder at Westville Prison, when he was shot and killed, allegedly by Sigcawu, another warder, in May last year. Thusi, who was at the Durban High Court on Monday as the case was set for trial, said the family yearned for justice. “We have fought and complained to the Westville police station about the investigation. We would have continued to fight until this case made it to court,” he said. Yesterday in court, Sce’s nephew Minenhle Shezi testified that his uncle died in his arms after sustaining multiple gunshot wounds to his upper body, and that the gunman was Sigcawu. “I was by the bar counter waiting to place an order and my uncle standing by the door outside. We heard a gunshot and then I saw my uncle walking in backwards and he was shouting, calling out Sigcawu’s name telling him to stop what he is doing. All the while shots were still being fired,” he said. He said Sce was shot while standing at the door of the Oasis Bar situated close to the Westville Prison recreational centre. Uncle and nephew had gone to the bar after watching a rugby match on the prison premises. Shezi said some patrons in the bar, which was about to close, ran for safety behind the counter while others tried to reason with the gunman. “We ran into the bar storeroom. I stayed there until the gunshots stopped ringing out. When I came out, I found my uncle lying on the floor.” The trial is continuing. Daily News
