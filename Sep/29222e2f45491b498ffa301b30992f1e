Durban - Litter booms are filling up along the Umgeni River after heavy rainfalls inland. This has led to litter washing up on Durban beaches between Isipingo and Umhlanga which has led to several beach clean-up initiatives on Saturday. Bly Williams, a Durban nature lover, said she was shocked to the see the state the Umgeni River banks were when she had participated in the SPCA Fun run/ walk on Sunday. The route takes people along the river banks in the Springfield Business Park area in Sea Cow Lake. "How can people continue to litter when so much of awareness is created around its repercussions. People have lost respect for the environment.  I saw a litter boom filled up and the embankments a mess behind Rochdale Road in Parlock," Williams said. In the north, the uMhlanga Urban Improvement Precinct said they were working together with the eThekwini Municipality Parks Department to clean up the beaches in their area following heavy rainfalls over the past weekend which led to the bursting of the uMhlanga Lagoon banks. The amount of litter that has washed up on the uMhlanga beaches has increased. Another group of volunteers will meet at the Beachwood Mangroves opposite the Blue Lagoon on Saturday. On the Bluff, the International Coastal clean up group in conjunction with the Wildlife and Environment Society of SA and eThekwini Municipality will begin cleaning Treasure Beach between Cuttings and Bluff on Saturday. The clean up will begin at 9am. Daily News
