Durban - Angry protestors were playing cat and mouse with Public Order Policing (POP) in Alpine Road on Tuesday - for the second day in a row. Residents living in the Jadhu Place informal settlement in Morningside, on a steep hill above Alpine Road, have been protesting since Monday for housing and basic service delivery. Tuesday morning's protest was a repeat of what transpired on Monday morning and later that night. Residents blocked the road between Hendry and Umgeni Road with tree branches, rocks and household refuse. Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, Durban Metro Police spokesperson, said both the SAPS and Metro POP had cleared the road themselves to allow traffic to pass through. "The protesters have gone into the suburb of Asherville to cause chaos. They blocked off the smaller roads in the suburb with rubble. The protestors also vented their anger at the police by hurling stones. This is unacceptable behaviour," Sewpersad said. eThekwini Municipality had not responded to an email regarding the housing issue. Mbulelo Baloyi, the spokesperson for the KZN Department of Human Settlements, told the Mercury newspaper that the department is working with the municipality on a way forward to build houses for all those living in informal settlements.
