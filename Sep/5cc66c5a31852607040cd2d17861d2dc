Durban - A concerted crime-fighting effort led to the arrest of two possible wanted criminals on the Bluff in Durban on Tuesday. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said the homeowner left his Lloyd Avenue home securely locked and windows were closed on Monday afternoon. On Tuesday, around midday, the homeowner received a call that his house was broken into and the window was damaged. The neighbourhood watch had seen the men getting into the home and raised the alarm by calling the police. By then the men had made off with several valuables, said Gwala, including a necklace. ET Rapid Response, a private security company, wrote on their  Facebook page that the burglars were seen on Lloyd Avenue when they got into a house and granny flat. They fled towards the Bluff Golf course area where they were arrested by Craig Cauldron from Bluff precinct ET Rapid Response. He was assisted by COP - Bluff, Shaun Venter and SAPS House Breaking Unit, Metro K9 Unit. The security company believes that the men have numerous warrants of arrests and pending cases ranging from armed robbery, attempted murder, house break-in, hijacking's between Gauteng to Durban. Gwala said the two suspects aged 29 and 32 were arrested and are still being profiled by police detectives. They will appear in the Durban Magistrates’ Court on Thursday. Riaan Brits the owner of the house wrote, on Facebook after reading about the arrest, that he hoped they will be put in jail and not let out (even on bail) as they are on the wanted list. Brits thanked all those involved especially the neighbourhood watch. Daily News
