Durban - A KwaDukuza mother was stabbed with a cane knife on a farm on Monday morning. Paul Herbst, a spokesperson for IPSS Medical Rescue, said they received several calls for assistance for a family that was attacked in their home on a farm just outside of KwaDukuza. "It is believed that the single assailant, armed with a cane knife, entered through the kitchen, where the attack took place. The mother flung herself in front of the attacker, so as to protect her child. The mother sustained serious injuries whilst her daughter was able to hide within the house," Herbst said. She was taken to hospital where she was being treated for her injuries. The daughter was left traumatised but not harmed physically. The assailant left the home after the mom and her daughters alerted neighbours by screaming. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KwaZulu Natal police spokesperson, said a suspect entered the farm in the Darrnel area, where he hacked the woman believed to be in her thirties with a cane knife at 6 am. "She sustained head and body injuries and was taken to hospital for medical attention. A case of attempted murder has been opened for investigation at KwaDukuza SAPS. The police are still searching for the suspect who fled the scene after the incident," Gwala said. On Tuesday,  five men held up an elderly couple, aged 80 and 88, before ransacking their home on the Rankin Farm in Glendale. It is alleged that the men gained access to the couple's home and looted their home and tuck shop. They then fled in the couple's bakkie. Daily News
