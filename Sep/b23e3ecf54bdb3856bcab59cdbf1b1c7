Mandla Nsele, the municipality’s deputy head of communications, said in its quest to rid the city of dirt and grime, the municipality had planned various clean-up campaigns across eThekwini. The campaigns would create awareness and educate the public on proper waste management practices. Yesterday, the Daily News visited taxi ranks, recreational areas and theme parks.Litter was collected at the taxi ranks and the beach. Areas surrounding Moses Mabhida and uShaka Marine World were spotless except for a few scattered papers. The most litter was found near the Bike and Bean in North Beach. The area is popular for braais and socialising. The tree bowls along the parking lot were filled with beer bottles and other litter. Nsele said that as part of the city’s waste management strategy, the city launched its clean-up month in Cato Manor, Ward 29, under the theme “No Litter In My Area”. “Cleansing and Solid Waste will then roll out various clean-ups in the city centre, townships and various informal settlements throughout the month. The campaigns will also involve education of residents about the importance of a clean, well-maintained city,” Nsele said. Raymond Rampersad, head of Cleansing and Solid Waste, called for everyone to take care of the environment by cleaning up areas in which they lived. He also encouraged residents and businesses to take ownership in keeping the eThekwini region clean, safe and healthy. “We all need to exercise correct waste management practices and instil a culture of a clean environment during the month of September and beyond,” Rampersad said.
