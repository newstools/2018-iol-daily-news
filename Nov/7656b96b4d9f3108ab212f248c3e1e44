Durban - Mr Fill Up himself, Cassper Nyovest, was in Durban this week to speak about his upcoming concert taking place at the iconic Moses Mabhida next month. On Thursday, Nyovest, real name Refiloe Maele Phoolo, visited local radio stations to talk more about #FillUpMosesMabhida.      During an interview with East Coast Drive's Bongani and Mags, Nyovest revealed that those attending the show can expect a number of Durban-based artists and friends of his like Babes Wodumo to join him on stage.      Cassper Nyovest will attempt to fill up the iconic Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on December the 1st. East Coast Radio are proud media partners to the #FillUpMosesMabhida event.  The concert will be the first to be held outside of Gauteng after Cassper’s #FillUpTheDome, #FillUpFNBStadium, and #FillUpOrlandoStadium. Apart from marketing about his concert, Nyovest also opened up about his feelings over the death of South African artist, HHP who died last week. Nyovest shared that HHP was more than just a friend to him. "He was more of a big brother. I go through so many emotions through the day, I am still numb. It still feels like a dream because it was so sudden. I have so many questions. You know, I sit in bed thinking maybe if I had called him that day things would be different. Man, I miss HHP," the multi-award winning artist said. Daily News
