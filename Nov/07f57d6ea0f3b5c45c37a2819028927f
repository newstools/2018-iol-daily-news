Durban - The mother of Baby X, who was sentenced to an effective 20 years behind bars was convicted on a number of charges including murder, sexual abuse and child abuse - including forcing her children to beg. While she was convicted on multiple counts, Judge Mohini Moodley ruled that the sentence must run concurrently. This is what Baby X's mother was sentenced to for each charge:   The court found that the 35-year-old woman had murdered her three-year-old daughter, who had endured being beaten, starved, burnt with cigarettes, had chilli powder put in her nappy and tied to a bed at night. Her mother and maternal grandmother were both charged for her murder and assault but the grandmother died of natural causes earlier this year while awaiting trial in Westville prison. Independent Media is not naming Baby X or her mother to protect her two younger siblings In November 2014, the weak, scarred body of the three-year-old girl from Havenside in Chatsworth was found at her home. During the trial, Dr Sibusiso Ntsele told the Durban High Court that the cause of death was “blunt force trauma following fatal child abuse”. Daily News
