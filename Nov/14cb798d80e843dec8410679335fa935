According to police, 37-year-old Gary Govender allegedly shot dead his 39-year-old wife, Mantombi Pearl Govender, in the Leisuredene area. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said when the murder was reported, Govender claimed his wife was shot by two unknown men. “Intensive police investigation linked him to the murder,” she said. Meanwhile, in northern KwaZulu-Natal a 29-year-old man appeared in the Hlabisa Magistrate’s Court for the alleged sexual assault and murder of his 2-year-old step-daughter, after being on the run for a month. Mbele said the child was assaulted with a wooden stick after messing herself in October. She said the child’s body was taken to a private mortuary where it was discovered she had also been sexually assaulted. He is expected to apply for bail next week. In a separate incident, three suspects were arrested in Gauteng on Monday and are expected to appear in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court soon for the murder of a teacher and her housekeeper. Mbele said the suspects were arrested after the investigation led police to Alexandra in Gauteng where they were found with valuables belonging teacher Nonhlanhla Zondi, 54, and her housekeeper Slindile Buthelezi, 27.
