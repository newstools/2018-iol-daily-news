Durban - A pregnant vervet monkey that was either run over by a car or fell from a great height died after being rescued by Monkey Helpline at the weekend. The organisation was called out to Umdloti to rescue an adult female monkey that was seen falling and stumbling in a parking area. “She was heavily pregnant, seemingly having problems giving birth. Already dilated, she was having contractions but thrashed around wildly,” Carol Booth said on her Facebook page. She said after the monkey was checked thoroughly by a vet, they decided the monkey may have been knocked by a car or fallen from a height. “She presented with concussion like behavior and we monitored her progress. Sadly she and her baby died shortly after sedation. Despite an emergency ceasar, baby was unrevivable and laid to rest with her mommy,” she said. In another incident, the Monkey Helpline rescued a monkey that was run over by a reckless driver in Westville and left on the road critically injured and at the risk of being run over again. KEW, the rescued monkey, was left concussed and motionless, but now he is making progress.   “He's still very concussed but is responding and drinking his Ensure nicely. He is also now holding himself up and started pulling himself into a sitting position,” she said. Daily News
