Durban - Heavy rains caused a wall to collapse onto Delta Road in Isipingo Beach on Thursday. Dharmanand Nowbuth, eThekwini PR councillor for Isipingo, said it was the boundary wall of one of the residents that collapsed onto the roadway. Both lanes of the road were closed off to traffic. Nowbuth said the homeowner had hired workers to clear the rubble and sand on the road. Nowbuth said one lane has been opened. "The city council built a retaining wall many decades ago because of the steep gradient of the road. The resident has built the boundary wall on his property. I will recommend that the retaining walls be reinforced. There is a possibility of sand erosion that has caused this," Nowbuth said. Nowbuth said the remaining boundary wall of the resident is also in danger of collapsing. He said the portion of theÂ road was eroded by the storms in October 2017. "The council must prevent future landslides and road erosion. The roads below must not be affected by heavy rainfall and sand erosion," Nowbuth said. Daily News
