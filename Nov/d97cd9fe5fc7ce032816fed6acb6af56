Durban - A Yellowwood Park dog, “Domino”,  has been hailed as a hero for saving the life of his owner after an armed robber shot and killed the beloved pet who barked viciously at a suspect at the gate of his home on Thursday. Blue Security spokesperson Andreas Mathios said the resident had heard, Domino, a cross between a border collie and a fox terrier, barking viciously at the front gate of his Francis Close home at around 9.15am. "The resident was inside his house and was just about to go outside to check why the dog was barking when he heard a gunshot ring out and the dog ran into the house. The dog had been shot in the stomach and died at the scene,” Mathios said. The resident, who asked not to be named, hailed the dog as a hero for saving his life. “If it wasn’t for the dog they would have got inside and it would have been me,” he said. Mathios said the suspect was believed to have fled with three other suspects in a silver Toyota Corolla Sprinter which had been seen parked on the road. Montclair SAPS are investigating the incident.
