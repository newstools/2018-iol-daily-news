Durban - The dog that was found trapped in a snare in a Shallcross Nature Reserve is back with its owner the SPCA said. The dog was caught in a snare but luckily sustained no injuries said Tanya Fleischer, spokesperson for Durban and Coastal SPCA. Fleischer said the owner noticed that the dog went missing on Sunday. She said the SPCA received calls from members of the public on Tuesday afternoon advising that they could hear a dog crying in the bushes. Inspector Moloi went out the same afternoon and met with the owner, at that time they could not hear the dog. A second call was received on Tuesday afternoon. Moloi returned on Wednesday morning to search for the dog. He was joined by  Inspector Ramsamy and Inspector Nkomo to continue with the search through the bush to find the dog. "During the search, they also discovered two decomposing german shepherd dogs trapped in a snare. At 2.30pm the dog was located.  We gave him water. The dog was very thirsty and drank water for at least 2minutes. The dog was also thin and hungry but did not eat the food offered to him as he was a bit frightened." Fleischer said. The SPCA was concerned about the snares being placed in the nature reserve although the community did inform them that people were trying to catch bush pigs that live in the bush. "We do not know who is putting the snares in the bush. The members of the community were a great help in the search and rescue. We thank them for their assistance. They advised that they regularly check for snares in the bush and often find stolen goods during their search." Fleischer said. Daily News
