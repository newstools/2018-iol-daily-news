Durban - The family of Durban troop scouter Janet Prest Talbot,59, heard what sort of impact she made on people she came across at a remembrance day service on Saturday. Talbot, of Glenwood, led the 4th Durban St Thomas scout troop. She died on Wednesday. The service was held at the St Thomas Church in Musgrave. "She will be profoundly missed. Just the stories that the parents and children told showed what a positive influence she had on the kids and parents, "said a parent Heather van Niekerk. “Janet was an incredible person with a great zest for life who made a huge impact on the lives of all she came into contact with. She was passionate about the outdoors, about youth development, community service and the important role of play” said Scouts SA Chief Scout Brendon Hausberger. ”I held Janet in high esteem and valued her input into our Scouting programmes. She was a woman of true integrity, who was always ready for a new adventure, eager to help, had a lovely sense of humour and was a true friend to all. Her drive to uplift children didn’t stop within Scouting. Her work in local communities through her holistic “Hi Five of Play” method changed many more lives. Her enthusiasm and vigour will be sorely missed.” Hausberger said. Talbot's funeral will be held, on Saturday 17 November 2018, at the St Thomas Church in Musgrave at 3pm. Janet is survived by her husband Stuart and her two daughters Anna and Alexandreo. Daily News
