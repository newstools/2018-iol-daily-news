Durban - The replacement of electrical cables at the Petronet Substation near Tweedie could lead to a disruption in traffic along the N3 between Hilton and Mooi River this weekend. As a result, motorists should expect large traffic volumes on the busy stretch of road. According to N3 Toll Concession spokesperson, Anita Heyl, the replacement work is set to take place on Sunday. Heyl warned motorists to obtain essential traffic information before travelling on the N3 Toll Route as traffic congestion may be experienced between Hilton and Mooi River. “All lanes towards Johannesburg in the northbound direction and Pietermaritzburg in a southbound direction will be closed to traffic between 8am and 11am on Sunday morning. The Road Traffic Inspectorate will stack heavy vehicles on either side of the closure and light vehicles will be diverted at Midmar and at Nottingham Road,” she said. Heyl said the RTI will manage traffic accommodation during the closure and N3TC’s Route patrol teams will be on standby to provide further assistance. Daily News
