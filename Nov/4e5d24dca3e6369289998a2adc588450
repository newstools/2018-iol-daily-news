Durban - A man was lucky to be alive after he allegedly veered his car off the road and into a dam near oThongathi on Monday Quentin Power, National Sea Rescue Institute Ballito station commander, said that at approximately 11 pm on Monday they responded to a motor vehicle collision at Dudley Pringle Dam. Power said they found a vehicle semi-submerged and trapped in dense hyacinth and sinking in the dam approximately 80 meters from the bank of the dam. "The driver of the vehicle was found safely ashore, he had exited the vehicle and we believe bystanders assisted him as he waded to shore through dense hyacinth. Paramedics medically assessed the man and he was not injured," Power said. Rescue swimmers from the Specialised Rescue Unit (SRU), the SA Police Services and NSRI waded out to the vehicle and confirmed that no other persons were in the vehicle. "The rescue teams assisted local breakdown and recovery services to recover the vehicle from the dam. Once the vehicle was recovered no further assistance was required," Power said. Daily News
