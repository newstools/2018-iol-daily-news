Durban - The Clean Blue Lagoon group is appealing to the public to assist them financially to pay volunteers to remove bags of refuse collected from the river mouth uMngeni River mouth. The team of volunteers embarked on their monthly cleanup on Saturday. "We had a boat to ship our bags across the river for easy collection by Wildlands. Unfortunately, that option is no longer available to us. For awhile the “fairies” would collect the bags during the week and remove them for us. This has not been happening. The bags were left uncollected and were breaking up and becoming a dump of its own," Dale Johnson the coordinator said. Johnson said it was heartbreaking work to repack the bags and clean up the site. "I have very dependable guys that would jump at the offer of some work. My cry for help is for donations to pay these guys to remove the bags from the Beachwood Mangroves area. We have 3 piles of bags that need removing. Any donation would be welcome."Johnson said.
