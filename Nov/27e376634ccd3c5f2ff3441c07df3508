Durban - The uMhlanga Urban Improvement Precinct (UIP) together with eThekwini officials will do a final clean up of uMhlanga beaches before re-opening it to the public on Friday. The UIP said on Thursday afternoon that the beach is clean but remains closed due to whale carcass fat pieces that still need to be cleared and the generally smelly conditions. The eThekwini roads department will send a high-pressure truck to help clean the ramp and area where skips were placed for the removal of the whale carcass. The UIP is also awaiting a final debrief from aquatic safety and other departments On Wednesday, the municipality began removing the whale carcass from the beach piece by piece. The carcass was loaded into skips bins and disposed off at a nearby landfill site. The UIP said it was not a nice end to a beautiful creature but the only solution given the situational circumstances. The whale had come ashore on Sunday near oThongathi. It was then towed out to sea by the NSRI. Due to tidal action the whale floated towards uMhlanga beach were it became stuck among the rocks between the pier and lighthouse. Daily News
