Durban - South Africans have been encouraged to be accountable and support projects that seek to protect the country’s wildlife. This was according to Carla Geyser an environmentalist, humanitarian and the founder of NPO- Blue Sky Society Trust. She, along with an all women crew, recently returned to Durban after embarking on an expedition from Johannesburg into Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia on a 50 day 11 235km expedition. “The country’s wildlife is part of our natural heritage and we need to be accountable for what is happening,” she said. The expedition themed Rise of the Matriarch team was aimed at creating awareness around wildlife and to raise funds for four causes: Elephants Alive (South Africa), Rare and Endangered Species Trust (Namibia), Eco-Exist Project (Botswana) and the Soft Foot Alliance Trust (Zimbabwe). “Donations we received so far total about R60 000, it’s not much and I was hoping for a bit more but people are feeling the crunch financially. For me raising funds doesn’t end with this expedition but is an ongoing process, it's not about just donating once and I encouraged people to do the same,” she said. Geyser said the figures were alarming with poachers killing approximately two rangers every week in Africa. “They (poachers) also kill on average 3 rhinos, 98 elephant and countless pangolin every single day. It is this harsh cold reality that spurred Geyser into action. For most people on our planet, disaster on this scale is overwhelming so they resign themselves to shake their heads in dismay and leave the job of saving our people and wildlife to someone else,” she said.
