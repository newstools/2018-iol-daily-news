Durban- The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) have welcomed the life sentences given to suspects who were responsible for the death of a police officer in 2015. Hawks spokesperson, Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said the life sentences would serve as a sign that there would be no tolerance for the killing of police officers. “Constable Delvin Vincent who was stationed at Margate Police Station was shot by three suspects while he was on his way home from a friend’s house. He was taken to hospital where he later succumbed to the injuries,” he said. Nkosiphendule Cwele (37), Douglas Hamann (43) and Msizi Ngubelanga (27), were connected to the death of Vincent at the trial. The trio had also been denied bail, and were in jail until they were convicted, and sentenced last week Mhlongo said. Although the sentence would not bring Vincent back, Mhlongo said this does give them solace in the fact that justice was served. He also thanked the national prosecuting authority for ensuring that the murderers were found guilty. The sentence comes as a traffic police officer, Themba Ndaba, from Greytown Municipality was murdered outside at the council’s yard. He was shot with an AK-47. The death resulted in police minister Bheki Cele visiting the family of Ndaba to pay his respects. Daily News
