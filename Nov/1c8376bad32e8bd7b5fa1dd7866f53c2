Durban - Domestic workers were left traumatized but unharmed after a gang of armed robbers forced their way onto a Durban North property and held them up at gunpoint on Thursday. Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said three robbers managed to gain entry onto the property in Portland Place by tampering with the gate. They confronted two domestic workers. Mathios said one of the suspects was wearing a blue Eskom overall. “The suspects, all carrying firearms, ransacked the house and grabbed valuables including jewellery, televisions, laptops, cellphones, R6000 in cash and a case of Jameson whiskey. They carried the stolen goods to an awaiting getaway vehicle, a white VW Golf which fled the scene. The gang also stole the resident’s vehicle from the premises,” Mathios said. The two domestic workers, said Mathios, were not harmed during the incident but were left traumatised and received debriefing counselling from independent counsellors at the scene.” Greenwood Park SAPS are investigating the incident.
