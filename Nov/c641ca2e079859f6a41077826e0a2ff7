Durban - Two cars have collided in the M13 near the St Johns Avenue offramp in Pinetown on Thursday. Ethekwini secure, a volunteer crime-fighting group, said one of the vehicles had overturned and landed on its roof. It is alleged that police might have been chasing the vehicle and a shootout ensued between the occupants of the vehicle and the police. The group said one person was arrested and a firearm was found at the scene. South African Community Crime Watch (SACCW) KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson Steven King warned motorists travelling in the vicinity to use an alternative route because it has now become an active police crime scene. King said it could take a while to clear the road. Police spokespersons are at the scene gathering information on what transpired. It is unclear what crime the suspects were involved in and if the car slammed into another motorist travelling in the same direction. Daily News
