Darrell Jacob appeared with his son, Jason, for a bail application. The two, apparently members of The Bloods gang, were arrested on Friday at their home in Phoenix. The Daily News’ sister paper the Sunday Tribune reported earlier this year how Lieutenant-Colonel Gavin Jacob gave protection to The Bloods, a gang operating in the Phoenix area. It is alleged that Gavin had sabotaged many cases involving Bloods gang members. A crime intelligence report on drugs and gangsterism in Durban had highlighted how 131 cases against gang members had been withdrawn between 2010 and 2017. Kalvin, 29, and Kevin Periasamy, 36, believed to be ring leaders in The Bloods gang, were arrested in January. During the bail application, defence attorney Chris Gounden argued that Darrell was the sole breadwinner and his family would suffer if he was jailed. Gounden said father and son did not have any previous convictions or pending cases against them. In addition, Jason, 18, had an exam to write today. Prosecutor Winnie Mlangeni said the two should not be released on bail as there would be a public outcry. Magistrate Vera Alamchand granted Gavin R3000 bail and R1000 to Jason. She said the two had to report to Phoenix police station every Friday. Also applying for bail yesterday was alleged taxi hitman Mduduzi Hadebe. In a case of the hunter becoming the hunted, Hadebe is alleged to have killed a taxi boss, but is now being hunted down by other hitmen. It is alleged that Hadebe and two accomplices killed taxi boss Mlungisi Maphumulo in the Hazelmere area in October. As they made their getaway, they were pursued by an unknown gang who chased them down to KwaDukuza and killed Hadebe’s two alleged accomplices. The 42-year-old survived with a gunshot wound in the leg and uses crutches to get around. During the bail application, Hadebe said he feared for his safety after being approached in hospital and asked to confirm his identity. The matter was postponed to November 21. Daily News
