Durban - The 28-year-old man charged with the murder of 11-year-old Pietermaritzburg boy Andile Fihla, whose decapitated body was found on Tuesday night, is appearing in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate's Court. Andile Fihla had been missing since November 9 before the man alleged to have taken him handed himself over to police and led them to his body. Police said that the Andile and his sister had been on their way to Msilinga Primary School in Copesville when they were stopped by two men from the area. “It's alleged the two men instructed his sister to continue walking to school and that Andile would follow soon. A member of the community noticed what was going on and informed Andile’s mother,” said police spokesperson Colonel Mbhele. She said his mother found out that Andile never arrived to school when she phoned. She reported Andile missing and a police search for the little boy did not yield any fruit. Police at the time took one of the men in for questioning and later released him while the second could not be tracked. According to Mbhele on Tuesday night the suspect who was being sought by police handed himself to the Pietermaritzburg Central Police Station. “The suspect led the police to the forest area behind Blubell Drive, Northdale, and the boy's head was found hidden under a rock that was covered with clothes,” she said. Mbhele said the suspect then led police to another area where Andile’s decomposing body was found. Andile’s mother, Lungiswa Khuboni, whom the Daily News spoke to yesterday morning after the little boy’s body was found, could not be reached to get a comment on the court appearance. Daily News
