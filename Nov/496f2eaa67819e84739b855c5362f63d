Durban - Firefighters had to contain a fire that gutted furniture store in the Riverhorse Valley on Wednesday. Narend Birjalal, senior division commander for the northern region, said they received a call at about 5pm. By the time firefighters had arrived the blaze was sweeping through the Ashley Furniture home store. Birjalal said when they got to the scene they proceeded to try and contain the fire. There were about 17 firefighters who had responded to the scene and there were three trucks used Birjalal said. A water cannon, breathing equipment to help the firemen while they were fighting the flames were also used, he said. “The fire was very intense and was going through the roof,” he said. Birjalal said they were able to contain the fire. He said it was still too early to say what was the cause of the fire. The fire caused huge traffic jams on the N2 near the Riverhorse Valley as people on social media were advising each other to stay away from the area to prevent being stuck in traffic. Daily News
