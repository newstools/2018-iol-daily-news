The bronze sculpture will feature the two men sitting on a bench at Luthuli’s home, which is now the site of the museum. The two leaders met on June 8, 1966. Soobben said his sketch was still in the design stages and had not yet been approved. “I am honoured to be part of this history. It is important to have a good design to aid the sculpture.” Luthuli was a South African teacher, activist, Nobel Peace Prize winner and politician. He was elected president of the ANC in 1952 and was awarded the 1960 Nobel Peace Prize for his role in the non-violent struggle against apartheid. Luthuli had been under house arrest, banished to the North Coast town, when he met Kennedy. In accordance with the ban imposed on him by the apartheid government, he was not allowed to be quoted or photographed by the media, so there is no detailed account of what was said at the meeting. However, the meeting left a strong impression on Kennedy, who later referred to Luthuli as one of the most impressive men he had met in his travels around the world. He hailed Luthuli’s compassion, understanding and tolerance as hallmarks of his greatness. Daily News
