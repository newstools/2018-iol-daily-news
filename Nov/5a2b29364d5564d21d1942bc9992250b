Durban - A driver and his assistant are lucky to be alive after the truck they were travelling in veered off the road and collided into a house in Parlock, North of Durban on Tuesday. Pictures of the crash show the extent of the damage to one of the rooms on the bottom level of the double storey house on Fatima Road. The house is situated at the T-Junction of Fatima Road. The house is below road level with a garden on its embankment. The truck had crashed through a brick wall before going down the embankment and smashing into the wall. The pillars to the upstairs balcony also collapsed on impact. The truck cab was completely crushed by the impact. Both the driver and his assistant were trapped in the front cab said Shawn Herbst, a Netcare 911 paramedics spokesperson. "The Ethekwini Fire and rescue services and a Netcare 911 rescue technician used the "jaws of life" to free the occupants. Once the patients were stabilized they were transported by another private ambulance service to a hospital," Herbst said. Reports from the scene indicate that the driver allegedly lost control of the truck. Daily News
