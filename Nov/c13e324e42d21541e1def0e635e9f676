DURBAN - The announcement of Naymaps Maphalala’s impending departing on Uzalo - the country’s most watched TV show - has caused a stir amongst fans on the show. Maphalala’s exit from the show was confirmed by the show on their Twitter page this week. He is set to leave the show along with veteran actor Glen Gabela and Thobile Mabika. Some fans have threatened to stop watching the show if Maphalala leaves, Isolezwe reports. “They should have fired Zekhethelo or MaMlambo instead,” wrote Saziso Maphosa, a fan of the show. Uzalo’s chief writer, Bongi Ndaba, confirmed the fourth season of the drama soapie had a lot of changes in store for fans. “We want to thank Naymaps Maphalala, Glen Gabela and Thobile Mabika for their contributions to Uzalo.
