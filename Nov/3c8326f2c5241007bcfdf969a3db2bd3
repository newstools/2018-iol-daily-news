Durban - Thousands of commuters in Newlands West were left stranded after bus and mini-bus taxi owners clashed on Monday. Buses blockaded Newlands West Drive and Riverdene Drive. It is alleged that mini-bus taxi owners blocked off Joyce Road disrupting the flow of traffic. It is not clear what the conflict was about but it could have stemmed from the shooting of a bus in Earlsfied Drive, Newlands West on Friday night. It is alleged that a bus belonging to  Freeline bus company had been hit by bullets from gunmen waiting on the roadside. The bus windscreen and one of the tyres were shot. It is not clear if there were passengers on board. A bus owner who declined to be named said the area has been very volatile because of route disputes. The roleplayers from the minibus and bus associations are expected to meet to resolve the dispute this morning. Durban Metro Police spokesperson Parboo Sewpersad said police received reports that a group of men gathered along Inanda Highway (M21) commuter stop near Joyce Road and began offloading passengers from the buses. "Police are on the scene monitoring the situation. No injuries have been reported," Sewpersad said. Daily News
