Durban - On Monday the eThekwini Municipality hosted the Nelson Mandela Challenge dinner ahead of tonight’s Nelson Mandela Challenge match between Bafana Bafana and Paraguay at Moses Mabhida Stadium. The dinner was hosted by the eThekwini Municipality, South African Football Association (Safa) and Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund. Also in attendance were both squads. Safa president, Danny Jordaan, said they are paying tribute to an icon of South Africa. Nelson Mandela, the world’s greatest humanist, the global icon who campaigned tirelessly for peace and emancipation of his people, will remain forever in our memory and our hearts. “My vision of football is also in line with Mandela’s vision of a caring society. With our program FIFA Forward, we are investing notably in youth and women’s football and creating opportunities for poor and underdeveloped countries. Football has the ability to create a better and positive future for everyone; and Mandela fully believed in this,” Jordaan said. He said Mandela remains one of the world’s most celebrated living icons and as an individual. Was a man whose appeal transgressed race, colour, religion and nationality. In our country, he remains a powerful symbol of hope, peace, forgiveness and reconciliation. The memories of his remarkable fight against oppression, his incredible charisma and his positive values will live on in us and with us in the worldwide football community. The match kicks off at 7pm. Daily News
