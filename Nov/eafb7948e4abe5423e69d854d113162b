Now, three months later, he is still waiting for the card to be delivered. We appreciate that computer systems will play up from time to time, and cause delays.

In Munsamyâ€™s case, it was not until he inquired four weeks after applying that he was told his application was not processed because the system could not read the image taken at the testing centre.

Surely the card-printing company should bear the cost of the temporary licences? Daily News
