Durban  - Traffic is still being diverted off the N3 Durban bound near Camperdown after a truck, transporting two shipping containers, overturned on Friday. Zinhle Mngomezulu, KwaZulu-Natal Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson, said the road was still closed and officials were diverting traffic from 7.30am. She said the cause of the crash was unknown at this stage. Mngomezulu said no injuries were reported. The overturned truck has occupied three lanes of the freeway just under an overhead bridge. The incident has left motorists frustrated because traffic has backed up on the busy route between Pietermaritzburg and Durban. Traffic is being diverted through Cato Ridge onto the R103 while emergency services and towing and recovery services attempt to lift the truck back onto its wheels. Boxes with goods inside, that the truck was carrying, also spilled out onto the road. Meanwhile, there will be a temporary closure of the N3 route between Howick and Tweedie until 10 am to allow for Eskom to replace stolen overhead power conductors. Daily News
