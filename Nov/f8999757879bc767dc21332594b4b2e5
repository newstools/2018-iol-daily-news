Vusi Tshabangu, 3M South Africa technical manager and application development engineer, and Steve Proctor from Traffic Management Solution Consultancy looked at practical solutions to improve road safety. Tshabangu said driver behaviour and infrastructure conditions contributed to road crashes. “3M cannot propose solutions on decreasing driver and vehicle collisions, but we propose that more of our roads have visible signage to inform drivers about the change in road condition,” he said. “We’ve got more trucks on the road and ageing drivers. These people need brighter signs for information, so we have to make signs brighter.” Tshabangu said there had been technological developments in this regard. His organisation has been working with municipalities and the Transport Department, and some municipalities have started installing brighter signage. “At the eThekwini Municipality, we have spoken to engineers and they have shown interest in changing the signage,” said Tshabangu. “Durban has a lot of trucks, so bigger roads and better signs are needed. There are quite a few cars moving in and around Durban after 6pm and many accidents happen at night.” Proctor said one first needed to establish the cause of fatal crashes to deal with the problem. “Places like Sweden and Norway have installed crash barriers where wire rope is supported by posts that are secured to the highway, and it stops cars from veering off. There are places where this is done in South Africa,” he said. Proctor felt that addressing pedestrian collisions required long-term solutions. “There should be a structured approach to traffic calming and speed humps in terms of their location,” he said. * This Sunday is World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims - the third Sunday of November each year - to remember those killed and injured on roads across the world.
