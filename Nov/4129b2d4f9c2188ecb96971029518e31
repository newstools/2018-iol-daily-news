Durban - The trial against three men in the Estcourt cannibalism matter continued in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Thursday. The three accused traditional healer, Nino Mbatha, Lungisani Magubane and Khayelihle Lamula were linked to body parts that were discovered after Mbatha allegedly walked into the Estcourt Police Community Service Centre with a pink school bag from which he pulled out a human hand and a foot. The body parts were later identified as being that of a missing woman, Zanele Hlatshwayo. A fourth accused in the matter Doctor Sithole died in prison this year. This week when the trial began the court heard how Mbatha at the police station said he wanted police to help him as he was being held against his will and was being forced to eat human flesh in the Sgodlweni area in Estcourt. On Wednesday, Constable Ndumiso Ryan Ntshalintshali, who was the one Mbatha found at the police station when he is alleged to have arrived with the human body parts, wrapped up his testimony. Investigating officer Nhlanhla Shabalala was expected to lead evidence on Thursday This after Ntshalintshali described on Wednesday how Mbatha led him Shabalala to a room where more body parts were found. The state in which the room was found and left came under the spotlight during Ntshalintshali’s cross-examination by Mbatha’s defence advocate Diane Franklin. She said a detective in the investigation, John Cloete, in his statement said he went into the room with Mbatha where he pointed out various things to him inside. “They left the room and when Cloete returned the room was ransacked..,” she said. Cloete is expected to take the stand after Shabalala. There is also expected to be a trial within a trial in the matter as Mbatha yesterday through his defence advocate Franklin said he was assaulted by police and that would be disputing a confession. The trial is set down till 14 December. Daily News
