Durban - Residents have stuffed refuse bags into a hole in the middle of Larch Road to warn motorists of the impending danger in Morningside on Thursday. The gaping hole appeared nearly ten days ago after contractors repaired a burst pipe. The massive trench is situated in the middle of the road. Larch Road is situated between Percy Osborn Road and Lillian Ngoyi Road. eThekwini Ward councillor Martin Meyer said he had informed the municipality of the problem. Residents living along the road said there was an accident waiting to happen so they became proactive and stuffed orange and blue refuse collection bags into the hole. In June 2013, the Daily News reported that Durban motorists were spending tens of thousands of rand to repair cars damaged by unprotected holes in the city. A giant hole in South Coast Road, near the busy intersection with Solomon Mahlangu (Edwin Swales VC) Drive had been cordoned off by a good Samaritan who placed a big rubbish bin in it, making it more visible to road users.
