Durban - Those visiting the Krantzkloof Nature Reserve in Kloof can expect to pay more in entry fees from December 1. The Kloof Conservancy made the announcement on their Facebook page. The post said Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife announced new fees for entry for their various reserves. “The new fees are R40 per adult and R20 per child under the age of 12 years. The fees apply to anyone entering the reserve from any point,” the post said. “Some local residents are "grumpy" that they have to pay an entry fee as they see this as a local facility and many have accessed the reserve for free for many years given that the reserve is not tightly fenced and there are numerous easy entry points. It is our view that there is no reason to be "grumpy"! The reserve is a valuable asset and it requires the support of all residents to ensure its protection.” It also said rates are reasonable for once-off visitors but frequent visitors are encouraged to get the Ezemvelo Rhino Gold Card for R250 per person per year, which also includes family rates. The Gold Rhino card gives holders unlimited access for a year to all Ezemvelo reserves. “We appeal to all residents to co-operate and conduct themselves with civic responsibility and to pay the entry fee as required or purchase a Gold Rhino Card,” it continued. However, the SANParks Wild Card does not apply to Krantzkloof Nature Reserve. Daily News
