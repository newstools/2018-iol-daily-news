Durban -  Only a handful of feral cats are left to sterilise at the King Edward Hospital in Durban. The announcement was made by Cats of Durban who head up a programme to sterilise cats. Nikki Moore, the founder,  said that after many years of disappointments and setbacks the hospital now has a stable colony of cats. Cats that have been sterilised had a portion of their ears clipped. "The story is a long one. More than four years ago we were called to King Edward because the hospital was overrun with cats. Kittens were falling through the ceilings, dead kittens were being found in drains, there was a horrible incident where a mum cat and her kittens were beaten to death in full view of patients in the maternity ward, cats were being run over by cars and left to rot, etc.  It was a nightmare." Moore said. On Mandela Day, Dr Sanil Singh of Vet Care Clinic in Overport offered us a spay clinic.  As Dr Singh is also the head of veterinary sciences at UKZN, he wanted this offer to benefit UKZN specifically. "However, the Medical School at King Edward Hospital is also part of UKZN, and as part of the spay clinic we were put in touch with doctors at the med school who was looking after the cats," Moore said. "It has been a long and sometimes frustrating exercise, but we are now confident that there will be no more dead kittens, starving cats, feline invaders or uncontrollable cats at King Edward!" Moore added. Daily News
