Durban - Orlando Pirates defeated Kaizer Chiefs 2-1 in a nail-biting Telkom Knockout semi final at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday. Speaking to Supersport’s Robert Marawa shortly after the match, KwaZulu-Natal’s Economic Development MEC Sihle Zikalala called for fans to remain disciplined at the stadium. Zikalala, who admitted to being a supporter of Orlando Pirates arch-rivals Kaizer Chiefs, thanked the fans who came out in their thousands to fill the Moses Mabhida Stadium to capacity. Tickets for the semi-final clash were sold out within hours when it was announced the semi-final clash would be staged in Durban. This after the Motsepe Foundation had booked the preferred venue in Johannesburg, the FNB Stadium, for a national prayer event. “The best team won,” said Zikalala. “If we support our teams, more games will come, if we are disciplined more games will come. People must understand the game is the game, if you lose, in future, you will win,” he said. His comments appeared to be pointed at Kaizer Chiefs supporters who vandalised the Moses Mabhida Stadium earlier this year when they lost to Free State Stars in a semi-final clash of the Nedbank Cup, leading to ex-coach Steve Komphela resigning days later. Zikalala urged fans to remain vibrant and support all the sports and events available in the province. Commenting on the game, Zikalala said: “Next time chiefs will do well”. Daily News
