Durban - Vandals set alight desks, a classroom and a car at the Wiggins Secondary School in Cato Manor on Monday. This is the second attack carried out at the school situated in Dunbar Road this year. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said in the early parts of the morning a group of people entered the school premises and set alight desks and a blue Toyota Yaris that was parked on the premises. Zwane said the windows on the school premises was also damaged. Police were still establishing who the Yaris belonged to. Durban Metro police spokesperson Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad said they received reports that a mob of 50 people attacked the security guards on the premises. He said charges of malicious damaged to property and public violence were opened at Cato Manor police station for investigation. Officials from the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education have inspected the damages to the school. In September desks, water pipes, books and food they had prepared to celebrate Heritage Day had been destroyed in the pandemonium on Wednesday night. The mob told the guards that they wanted theÂ land near the school to build on. It is unclear if this was the same motive again. Daily News
