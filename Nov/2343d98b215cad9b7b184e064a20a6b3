The bridge is a crucial section of a new route in the city’s integrated public transport network, GO!Durban, and will run from uMhlanga New Town to Bridge City, KwaMashu. Single lanes in both directions (east and west), which are essentially a continuation of uMhlanga Ridge Boulevard, will be open to traffic from tomorrow. The broad bridge accommodates two dedicated bus rapid transport (BRT) lanes in the centre and two lanes in each direction for motorist access. According to Thami Manyathi, the head of the city’s Transport Authority, pedestrians should be mindful of road safety rules around this area because of its close proximity to the informal settlement of Blackburn and the large Cornubia housing estate. “We are seeing pedestrians not using the walkways provided for them, as well as crossing the N2 with vehicles and trucks travelling at high speed, and we are most concerned about their safety, as well as the repercussions for road users should an accident occur,” said Manyathi. “We appeal to pedestrians in the area to be aware that motorists will now be using the bridge and off-ramp, and that there will be active construction vehicles on the boulevard and the off-ramps as construction on the new route continues. “Pedestrian sidewalks across the bridge and along the Blackburn off-ramp have been constructed and we implore the community to please use those, for their own safety,” said Manyathi.
