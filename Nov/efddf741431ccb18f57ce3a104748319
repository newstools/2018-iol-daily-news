Zwane said several targets were identified and their flats were searched and various drugs were seized. "The first arrests was in Pascal Place where a plastic packet with cocaine powder as well as 5400 pink and white capsules suspected to be heroin was seized. The police officers then moved to a second target in Hime Street and arrested a second suspect who was found in possession of several cell phones suspected to be stolen. He was charged for possession of suspected stolen property. On further investigation, it was established that he was sought by police for other crimes," Zwane said. Police then arrested a man for possession of cocaine in Woodville Road. Two more flats in Alabama Road were raided and two men were arrested for dealing in drugs, rock cocaine and dagga. The police officers seized 330 small clear packets containing dagga in their possession. "The operation continued in the area in an attempt to get rid of illegal firearms and drug trade. Whilst at Woodville Road, information was gathered of criminal activities in one of the flats in the area. The police officers followed up on the information which led to the recovery of three 9mm pistols as well as ammunition and heroin tablets. No one was arrested but investigations are continuing."Zwane said. All five suspects aged from 20 to 40 were arrested and will appear in the Wentworth Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Daily News
