Durban - A UKZN lecturer has won the Young Linguist Award at the prestigious 20th annual International Congress of Linguists, held for the first time on African soil since its inauguration in 1928. Muhle Sibisi walked away with the prestigious award at a ceremony held at the Cape Town ICC recently. "Such an award is both motivating and challenging one to work even harder. "As a budding linguist, it is an honour to be recognised for the work I do. It gives me the confidence to soldier on, now that my foot is in the door. It gives me a sense of belonging in Linguistics as a field of study on the one hand and to the international community of linguists on the other hand," Sibisi was given the award based on her presentation entitled Exploring attitudes towards the use of poetry in the presentation of academic content in isiZulu, in which she conducted an exploratory study wherein poets recited a Linguistics academic concept as a poem in isiZulu. Sibisi, whose research interest lies in language policy, believes that isiZulu and other African languages are ‘under-used’ in accessing knowledge including academic knowledge. "The use of African languages in Higher Education would enhance opportunities for access and success for the speakers of these languages,’ she claims. She hopes to engage in future studies that impact on people’s lives such as research on the use of isiZulu (and possibly other African languages) to disseminate knowledge in the education sector and in the public sphere. "To the student fraternity I would like to say – hang in there. We need to work hard, not just for ourselves but for the future generations and the betterment of our world,’ advised Sibisi.
