We appreciate the work done by economic development MEC Sihle Zikalala, Minister (Economic Development) Ebrahim Patel for ensuring that this operation is back at work," she said. She said she would be going back to the area to announce the interventions since the closure of Rainbow and will be opening more opportunities. She announced the launch of the Hilltop Social Housing Development in Bellair, south of Durban, which is aimed at delivering "decent and affordable" rental services to the medium working class.
