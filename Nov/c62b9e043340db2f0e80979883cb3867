Durban - South African hip hop star, Cassper Nyovest, has a dream. And that dream is to see a massive increase in support for local music. He hopes that his Fill Up series of concerts will begin to inculcate a love for local music and help grow the industry. The multi-award winning artist said even if it means that one day he performs alongside another local artist and he is not the face of 'Fill Up', then it means his mission has been accomplished. Nyovest, real name Refiloe Maele Phoolo, was speaking at a meet and greet on Tuesday ahead of his #FillUpMosesMabhida concert which takes place on December 1. The idea, according to Nyovest, it to get artists to perform at sold out venues across country, where locals have come out in their numbers to support South African artists. He said South Africans are prepared to spend up to R1000 (or more) to watch international artists yet they will not spend R100 to see a local artist performing. Nyovest said the decision to host his concert in Durban came after numerous fan requests. He added that he also ran a poll on his Twitter account and Durban was the most voted for venue. “Durban is the most exciting city in Africa,” he said. Speaking on whether he believed he could actually fill the stadium, Nyovest said it was always a scary thought. “I do not worry about how many tickets were sold. I leave that to my team. It would stress me out. I just focus on the show,” he said. He said he believed that this show would be different compared to his previous Fill Up concerts at the Johannesburg Dome, FNB Stadium and Orlando Stadium held over the last three years. “I believe that I have grown as an artist and as a performer,” he said. Nyovest revealed that he will also be launching his CD at the concert. Nyovest moved to dispute claims that his concert to fill up the 85 000-seater stadium was partly funded by eThekwini Municipality. Daily News
