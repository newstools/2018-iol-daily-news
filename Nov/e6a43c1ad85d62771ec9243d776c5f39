Durban - The Kloof Conservancy is pleading with drivers to slow down after a young Water Mongoose was knocked over at the weekend. The Conservancy said in the last two-and-a-half years, a porcupine, a young caracal and now the water mongoose have been killed. The organisation’s chairperson, Paulo Candotti, said these are just the animals that they were aware of. Candotti said they arrived on Sunday to find the carcass of the animal  which was believed to have been knocked over at the Kloof Falls picnic site.  Management said the crossing is used by many animals that move between the main gorge through to the Longshadow area at the reserve. “We have previously appealed for motorists to adhere to the speed limit of 40km/h but 95% of motorists ignore the speed limit. I have had drivers flash lights at me, drive up my exhaust pipe, hoot at me, overtake me and give lots of rude hand gestures simply because I drive at the speed limit,” Candotti said. He said they have appealed for speed reduction measures to be placed in the area but are told the road is a priority through-road. “We are told that the road does not warrant speed reduction devices such as speed bumps or camera traps based on a survey that was undertaken,” he said. Candotti said the volume of hikers crossing the road from the picnic site to the trails is very high at weekends. “It is a nightmare to cross because of the speeding vehicles – most motorists seem to treat it as a grand prix track. It is just a matter of time before a human is run-over,” he said. Candotti said accidents can happen but if motorists drive at the speed limit of 40km/h there is a reasonable chance that they will be able to stop if they spot an animal on the road.  “We appeal once again to all motorists using Kloof Falls Road and Bridle Road to please do what the law requires of you and drive at the regulated speed of 40km/h.
