The matter was brought to our attention by mechanical engineer Denzil Bazley. As someone who helped with maintenance at the plant between 1997 and 2008, he knows what he’s talking about. Once alerted by bikers at Giba Gorge, Bazley and colleagues had the discharged water tested and found it had extremely high levels of E. coli. This was particularly dangerous for communities living downstream of the plant and who rely on the river to meet their daily water needs. Bazley brought the matter to the attention of the eThekwini Municipality and the Daily News. We publicised the issue and the municipality responded by taking the necessary steps to improve the plant’s performance. Two weeks later we are happy to report the vastly improved quality of water being discharged from the plant. This is an excellent example of participatory democracy in action and shows what can be achieved if everybody works together. Now, for the solution to be lasting, the municipality needs to enforce the by-laws concerning the disposal of fats, oil and greases from restaurants in the area, which impacts on the plant. Or better yet, the restaurants could participate positively by not pouring oil down the drain. Daily News
