Durban - Almost a week after an 8-year-old KwaZulu-Natal girl was reported missing, her body parts were found in a toilet on Thursday morning. The location of the body parts was pointed out to police by the man accused of the girl’s murder. The man is believed to be a family member of the young child. Last week, Celimpilo Nosbusiso Sibiya was reported missing. Provincial police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said Celimpilo was seen in the Driefontein area. According to her family, she would often visit other homesteads in the area. Zwane said on Thursday morning the search led officers to a house in Driefontein. “Investigations by our police officers, who were working around the clock searching for the child, led them to the house of a family member who was questioned about the girl’s disappearance,” he said. Zwane said in the early hours of Thursday morning, the 36-year-old man pointed out two pit toilets where the girl’s body parts were found. “The man was charged with murder and is due to appear in the Ladysmith Magistrates Court soon," he said.
