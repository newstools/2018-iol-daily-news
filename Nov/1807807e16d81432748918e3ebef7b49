Durban - Members of the LGBT+ community will now be able to report issues of discrimination and harassment at the newly launched Safe Spaces offices across the city. The programme was officially launched on Wednesday with 12 councillors being trained on how to deal with complaints. Councillor Chris Pappas said the idea was spurred by the number of complaints that the Democratic Alliance had received about members of the LGBT+ community being discriminated against when they went to report incidents at local government offices.  “The project aims to provide spaces where members of the LGBT+ community can take their service delivery issues to and feel safe at the same time. Also, councillors have never been trained on how to deal with sensitive issues involving hate crimes or discrimination,” he said. Pappas said the project was launched by eThekwini councillor, Nicole Graham and leader of the LGBT+ movement in the province, Councillor Caelee Laing. The project will soon be rolled out in the rest of KwaZulu-Natal, including rural areas and townships. Pappas said it was important to note that the Safe Spaces offices do not provide counselling services but have councillors and office assistants who have been trained to direct issues to the correction Non Government Organisation. “Some councillors are also trained social workers who can assist as a moment’s notice,” he said.
