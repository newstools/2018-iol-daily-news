Shaun Naidu, 35, brother of international wrestler Daryl Naidu, who performs as Nightmare, was on his way home when he had car trouble and pulled off on a bridge after the Shallcross off-ramp. He said a young man came along and offered to help him. Naidu, who had his windows slightly open, asked the man to push the car to try to get it started again. When the car failed to start, Naidu called Daryl to bring him a booster cable. He said the man had walked away, but returned a few minutes later with a knife, demanding his cellphone. “He threatened to stab me in the throat. His hand could barely fit through the glass, but he kept lashing at me with the knife,” Naidu said. The man then grabbed the key and tried to jerk it out of the ignition. Naidu said he grabbed at the knife and they grappled for it. “I had the seat belt on and this limited my movements. He stabbed me on the arm and the palms of my hand. I gave him R12, thinking he would run away, but he went into a fit of rage. Watching my brother wrestle taught me a few self-defence tactics, so I used these to ward him off,” Naidu said. He had multiple slashes on his hand and palms, and had to have stitches on his left arm. Naidu advises people who have car trouble to leave the car and seek help. “Don’t be a sitting duck and an easy target for criminals. Your life is more important than the car. You cannot assess if the people walking past will help or rob you,” Naidu said. Daryl Naidu said that when he arrived, he saw the man run across Higginson Highway and escape along the railway tracks. “He was laughing as he made his escape. I am angered and am going to direct all of this to creating awareness, because imagine if it was a woman or elderly person in my brother’s shoes? These drug addicts will kill or do anything to support their habits. The good thing is my brother will recover, and I am grateful he is alive,” he said. Chatsworth police are investigating. Daily News
