The eThekwini Municipality said five of its pools would not be open; uThukela said all nine municipal pools would be open; and all seven pools in the Msunduzi district would be open. In Durban, the most recent to be added to the casualty list was the Kings Park indoor pool, which had experienced excessive water loss, leading to its closure, said eThekwini spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela. He said it was closed after deliberation with all concerned parties, including KwaZulu-Natal Aquatic, who agreed that the work would begin on October15. The envisioned completion date was the end of February. The closure would also allow for the repair of structural and sub-surface latent defects in the roofing systems. Of the city’s 52 pools, Rachel Finlayson (structural refurbishment of pool - contractor on site), uMlazi BB (to replace all faulty pipelines with new piping - contractor on site), Newlands (refurbishment of pipework and tiling) and Firwood (investigation of water loss), were closed for major repairs. uMhlathuze Local Municipality spokesperson Mdu Ncalane said all nine municipal pools were operational and ready for the festive season. Msunduzi spokesperson Ntobeko Ngcobo said their seven municipal pools would also all be open for the festive period. The following pools are operational after undergoing rehabilitation: * Shallcross (refurbishment of swimming pool, filtration and change room facilities), * Mariannridge (re-tiling) * Verulam (refurbishment and filter plant), * uMlazi G (repairs to main supply line to pool, excavated and repaired), * Tills Crescent (tiling of swimming pool and paving of surrounds), * KwaMashu D (upgrading of filter plant). The municipality also has two new pools. One is in Inanda, north of Durban, a 25m standard pool with recreational paddling pools. The other is in uMgababa, south of Durban, a 50m Olympic-size pool and a toddlers’ pool. Daily News
