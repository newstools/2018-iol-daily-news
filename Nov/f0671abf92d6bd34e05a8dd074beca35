Durban - Nine men convicted for public violence at the Moses Mabhida Stadium will be sentenced in December. On Wednesday, 11 men appeared in the Durban Regional Court. Charges against two were provisionally withdrawn.

The court heard that probation reports were outstanding. The men were arrested following the incident of public violence at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on April 21, 2018. The suspects were allegedly part of a group of hundreds of fans who stormed the pitch, destroyed infrastructure and assaulted security guards after Kaizer Chiefs lost to Free State Stars in a Nedbank Cup semi-final match. They were arrested a week later. The Independent on Saturday reported that during the incident, 18 people had to receive medical attention, and damage to the stadium is estimated at R2.6 million. This includes damage to the pitch, the goal posts, fencing, crowd management barriers, bins, water points, dinner plates, glasses, chairs and tables. Daily News
