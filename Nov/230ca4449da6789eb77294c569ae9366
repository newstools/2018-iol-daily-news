Durban - To help fight against the scourge HIV and AIDS South African Breweries will donate 1,5 million condoms to taverns and bottle stores across Gauteng for World Aids Day, on Saturday. A million male condoms and 500 000 female condoms will be delivered to approximately 2 500 licenced taverns and bottle stores. Since 2010, SAB has helped to distribute close to 19 million condoms to approximately 15 000 licensed local taverns across South Africa. “SAB’s commitment to helping bring social change in South African communities is aligned to government’s aim to reduce the impact caused by HIV and AIDS in the country. "It, therefore, makes perfect sense that we contribute to the work being done to achieve this aim”, says Zoleka Lisa, Director Corporate Affairs, SAB. According to the John Stover study (Founder and President of Futures Institute, USA), 19 million condoms are able to help avert an estimated 38 000 new HIV and AIDS infections. The study further claims that for every 500 condoms distributed, at least one HIV and AIDS infection is averted. Daily News
