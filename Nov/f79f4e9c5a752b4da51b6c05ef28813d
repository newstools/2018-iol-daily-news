Durban - Three people are expected to appear in the Estcourt Magistrate's Court on Friday facing charges attempted murder, possession of a stolen motor vehicle and illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. Police said they were still looking for the attempted murder suspect who they describe as a dangerous criminal. "He is described as the most dangerous criminal, always clad in a bulletproof vest, carries a rifle with a number of rounds of ammunition at all times," said police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele. On Thursday an intelligence-driven operation by Amangwe police resulted in the arrest of the three suspects aged between 24 and 33. Police were searching for a suspect who allegedly attacked a man twice on different occasions. A case of attempted murder was opened at Estcourt and Amangwe police SAPS. Police received information that the suspect was travelling in a stolen Toyota bakkie with other three occupants in the Rosedale area. "The members waited for the said vehicle and when the suspect and his friends noticed the police vehicle they immediately alighted from the vehicle and fired shots at the police. "Police retaliated and one suspect was injured and another suspect was arrested with no injuries. The suspect that was sought for two attempted murder cases managed to evade the arrest with a friend," said Mbele. Mbele said police recovered cellphones, an AK47 rifle with 80 rounds of ammunition and a pistol with several rounds of ammunition as well as the Toyota bakkie which was hijacked in the Orange Farm, Gauteng province. Initial police investigation revealed that one of the arrested suspects had another unlicensed firearm at his homestead in Amangwe. "When police arrived at his home, they found a 24-year-old woman in possession of the said firearm. She was immediately arrested and charged for possession of unlicensed firearm." Daily News
