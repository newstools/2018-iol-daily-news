Durban - Ten people are expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Monday for charges that include allegedly selling fake tickets and ticket resale to the Telkom Knockout Semi-Final soccer match between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates on Saturday.  The match which took place at Moses Mabhida Stadium was relatively incident-free said police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane. "There were no serious incidents reported during the match due to the high-security presence and visibility. Police in KwaZulu-Natal with other security agencies ensured that spectators as well the players were safe." Ten suspects, between the ages of 20 and 45 were arrested. Seven were arrested for alleged ticket resale, two for selling fake tickets and one was arrested for pitch invasion. There were no serious incidents reported during the match due to the high-security presence and visibility. Nine men convicted for public violence at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in April will be sentenced in December. The suspects were allegedly part of a group of hundreds of fans who stormed the pitch, destroyed infrastructure and assaulted security guards after Kaizer Chiefs lost to Free State Stars in a Nedbank Cup semi-final match. There were R2.6 million damages. Daily News
