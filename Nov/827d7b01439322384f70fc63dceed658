Durban - It was a tragic start to the weekend after two truck drivers died in a collision on the R103 in Nottingham Road, KwaZulu-Natal on Friday. Shawn Herbst, spokesperson for Netcare 911 said three trucks had collided just after 6 am. Herbst said two occupants of one of the trucks had died and one occupant of another truck was left in a serious condition. "The injured patient was treated on scene by an advanced life support paramedic and transported by another private ambulance service to a hospital for further medical treatment," he said. The mangled wreckages of one of the truck cabs showed the impact of the collision. Two of the trucks appeared to have been travelling in the same direction on the stretch of road when a truck from the oncoming lane slammed into one of them head-on. The truck travelling behind also crashed into the truck in-front of it. Daily News
