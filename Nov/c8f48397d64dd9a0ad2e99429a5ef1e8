Blood stocks fluctuate all year, and with just days to go until the start of the festive season, SANBS has 3.1 days of stock, with AB+ stock at 100% capacity and AB- stock at 40%. SANBS regional marketing manager Sifiso Khoza said although the festive season was a fun time for most people, it was tough for doctors who worked hard at saving lives and often needed blood and blood products to do so. “Traditionally, December is a difficult time for SANBS, as we are unable to collect the 3000 units of blood a day that are needed to treat patients, like those who are terminally ill, let alone any trauma incidents. If the previous year’s blood stock levels over the same period are anything to go by, we know that we have some tough times ahead,” he said. Khoza said KwaZulu-Natal planned special blood drive promotions into January next year, with extended hours and additional weekend drives. “SANBS appeals to the public for help. As we head into the busy holiday season, we are facing a particularly challenging situation and need blood and platelet donors to replenish the blood supply for hospital patients who are counting on us,” he said. Khoza added that it was possible to meet the demand. In September, Khoza had said KZN needed 500 units daily, but was experiencing difficulty in achieving that. He said they aimed to maintain stock levels of five days, with 3000 units collected nationally each day. Daily News
