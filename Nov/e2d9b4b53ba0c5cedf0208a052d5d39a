Durban - Game over. That was the phrase used and written on school uniforms at Durban Girls Secondary School on Monday as thousands of matric students completed the last common exam paper of their high school life. When the two and a half hours had ended for the English Home Language exam, the students spilled out of the classroom in jubilation. As is the tradition in some schools, many of theÂ pupils wrote farewell messages on each other's uniforms. Most pupils at Durban Girls Secondary School said the exams were easy and have high hopes that they will achieve excellent marks. Halalisani Bebee from Newlands East said she was relieved that the stresses of the exams were over. She said she planned to distress by spending the festive season with family at home. Bebee said she could not wait to start her higher education studies next year. "I am already registered for supply chain management. I am excited because I am going to study something I enjoy," she said.  Nomfundo Dlamini from KwaMashu said the overall exams were not bad. She said she panicked about Business Studies, but found the paper to be easy. Dlamini plans to further her studies in Drama. "I love drama. I am going to make my family proud. Watch the space, this girl is going to be seen on TV," she said. Zamanguni Gumede said she found the English paper easy.  "I finished my exam paper before time and had enough time to go over my answers. I am definitely going to do well," she said. The bubbly 16-year-old from KwaMashu plans to study performing arts next year. "I want to make my community of KwaMashu proud of me when she's famous," she said. The matric exams officially end on Wednesday when some pupils write Agriculture Management Practices and Design.
