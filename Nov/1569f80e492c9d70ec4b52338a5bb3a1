Durban - A Newlands East grandmother won a gold medal at the senior citizens national Golden Games held in Bloemfontein. Edith Bezuidenhout,67, and her partner Patsy Gradidge won the 4 x 100 relay. Bezuidenhout was selected to represent KZN after winning the local district competitions. Besides keeping fit she is also a mother to three children, two men and one woman. She also has seven grandchildren. Bezuidenhout said she prepared for the event by running and a healthy meal diet. She is also a member of the Newlands East senior citizens club. "I eat normal meals but my supper consists of steamed vegetables and a protein with them. I always encouarged the children to keep fit. I often run with the children from the road I live on. They were surprised to see a granny running with a tyre, attached to ropes around her waist, behind her." Bezuidenhout said. Each year the KZN Department of Sport and Recreation (DSR) and the provincial Department of Social Development, the Office of the Premier, Department of Health and other partners host the popular Golden Games for senior citizens. This is a programme for persons 60 years and older, and is part of Government’s Older Persons Programme.  Participants representing their districts take part in a number of active and fun games ranging from track athletics to duck walk, dress up, ball throwing and, for those in wheel chairs, washing pegs “pegging”. There are activities for every level of fitness and ability. The participants compete in two age groups - sixty to sixty-five, and seventy and older. A number of them are well into their eighties!While medals and trophies are awarded, the emphasis is on everyone having fun by being active, socialising, and enjoying a bit of travelling. Daily News
