Pretoria - Nine men, including two police officers, were arrested on Monday, for truck hijacking in Boksburg, Gauteng police said. Spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said the police officers were a captain and a constable. "Gauteng police management received with dismay, information that two police officers in full uniform and a marked police vehicle were escorting a truck that was allegedly hijacked. Management is equally appreciative that the criminals within its ranks have been exposed and arrested," Masondo said. "Police on routine patrol in the early hours of Monday morning noticed a truck being escorted by three vehicles including a marked police car in the N12 highway in Benoni.
