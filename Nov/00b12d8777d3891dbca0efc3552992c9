Previously, taxi drivers operating in the city would choose someone off the street who they wanted as their conductor for the day, and would spend the day with them looking for passengers. However in October, the South Beach and North Beach Taxi Association announced that conductors would no longer be needed. “To all our commuters, be advised that all the conductors have been dismissed as from today (November 1). We have hired some of the conductors to be rank marshals...”, read one of the Facebook posts. The association said two South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) cars would patrol Dr Pixley KaSeme (West) and Anton Lembede (Smith) streets, looking out for vagrants and drivers behaving badly. Wealth Gcumisa, the City Circle Taxi Association’s chairperson of disciplinary hearings, said most central associations decided to get rid of conductors because they abused passengers. “Most were also involved in drugs and also robbed passengers. The conductors would also swear at passengers and not return their change. In other cases, they would fight over passengers and sometimes they would grab a passenger’s groceries, put them in one taxi while the commuter gets onto another taxi. So we decided to kick them out,” Gcumisa said. “We made this decision and aligned it with the eThekwini Municipality’s and safety and security plan to clean up the city and keep passengers safe,” he said.
