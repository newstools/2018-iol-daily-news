The 31 Club is a non-profit organisation that raises funds for charities in KwaZulu-Natal. “We decided to launch a Santa Surprise Hamper at our high tea. We have supported a school in the Point area for the past few years, Clare Ellis Brown Pre-Primary School, which is headed up by Nora Saneka. It is home to about 91 children between the ages of 3 and 6 who come from one of the poorer parts of Durban,” said 31 Club public relations officer Katie Nieman. Nieman said the 31 Club had regularly been invited to the school’s year-end concert and afterwards the club hosted a party with a gift for each child. “This year being the school’s 70th anniversary, we wanted to do something extra special for the children and decided on a Santa Surprise Hamper with 31 Club supplying the hamper,” she said. Ann Osborne, 31 Club co-chairperson, said each hamper contained an item of clothing, toiletries, toys, stationery and a sweet treat in a reusable container. Every Christmas, Sally Mcaslan, looks out for something like this and chooses two hampers, for a little boy and girl. “I don’t have children at home and no grandchildren yet, so I enjoy finding gifts for these children,” she said. Nikki Walker said she got three hampers, one for herself and her two friends. “We are given the age and name of the child, this way you can imagine the child,” Walker said. “It’s nice to know that a child will open this at Christmas.”  For more information on the initiative, email pro@31club.co.za, or call Ann Osborne at 0832893112 or Jo Behr at 0833266634.
