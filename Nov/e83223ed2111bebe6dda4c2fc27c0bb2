Durban - Three men brandishing 'big knives' held up a Hillcrest couple in their home on Monday. The house robbery had occurred just after midday on Old Main Road. The men allegedly got into the gated housing complex by pushing a portion of the fence over to create a gap. The couple were approached by three suspects who entered the premises through an unlocked door said Colonel Thembeka Mbele, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson. "At knifepoint, the suspects tied them with cable ties and robbed them of their belongings before fleeing the scene in an unknown direction."Mbele said. The South African Community Crime Watch (SACCW) reported that the men had big knives and took a TV, laptop and cellphones. Despite a concerted effort by the neighbourhood watch to apprehend the men, even with the use of a drone, they managed to escape. Steven King, the KZN chairperson of SACCW, thanked Hillcrest SAPS for a speedy response as well as the Westriding NHW, Blue Security, SACCW Operations, Careline Crises Centre, and Eddie for the use of his Drone. ' "The suspects were spotted but fled on the railway line towards Embo, despite a huge search of the area no suspects were arrested this time. We have seen an increase in crime in the Outer West. Please remain vigilant at all times. Mbele said a case of robbery was opened at Hillcrest police station for investigation. Daily News
