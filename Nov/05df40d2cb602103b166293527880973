Durban - Concerned residents of the Shallcross community rallied together to locate a dog that was trapped in thick bushes for two days on Wednesday. The dog had been lost inside a greenbelt between Langerberg, Alpine Drive, Rocky Mountain, Jura street, Willow and Holly Hock Roads in Shallcross. Mahendra Lillkan, Shallcross Crime forum spokesperson, said residents had heard the dog crying on Tuesday but despite a search of the thick bushes they could not locate it. Lillkan said with the assistance of a resident Gerrard Singh and three inspectors from the Durban and Coastal SPCA the dog was located on Wednesday afternoon. "The dog was caught in a snare. Thanks to its good fighting spirit it never gave up.Â There were other dogs found in the nature reserve that was not so lucky. We believe vagrants that live in the reserve put up the snares. The owner of the dog will be located once the SPCA conduct their tests," he said. Daily News
