Ipsos, a global market research company, was conducting the research on behalf of the Tobacco Institute of Southern Africa (Tisa). Danielle Crouch, a key account manager at Ipsos, said Tisa had noticed that consumption levels of cigarettes were staying the same, but members of the organisation were losing market share. “They knew that there was something causing this, but just did not know what it was,” Crouch said. She said the price of cigarettes was normally determined by the amount of money paid in excise duties, which was R17.85 per pack, by tobacco companies to the South African Revenue Service. This amount did not include VAT. She said anything less than R17.85 was deemed to be illicit. Crouch said what stood out was the wide distribution of illicit cigarettes in the country. Ipsos talked to various store owners during the year and yesterday’s research was conducted in Isipingo. Their questions included the price of cigarettes that retailers sold, and the amounts sold. She said most illicit products were fully compliant with the packaging, which included a number of requirements such as health warnings and barcodes. Wendy Cele, a field worker at Ipsos, said they had found that smokers abandoned big brands in favour of smaller brands because of the price. She said local retailers, which included informal traders, said that foreign shop owners sold cigarettes at a cheap price that forced them to follow suit and sell illicit brands. “Customers were aware of the difference in quality between the big established brands and illicit cigarettes as they often complained that the poor quality made them sick. “Because of the price, they end up buying them,” she said. According to Cele, some whole- salers denied selling illicit cigarettes and hid them in their storerooms. Cele said illicit brands were often sold in Durban’s CBD and also in rural areas. She said loose cigarettes could be sold for as little as R1 in the city, and for 50 cents in rural areas. Daily News
