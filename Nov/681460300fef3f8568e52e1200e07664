Durban -  A Durban private security company described the shooting at one its response officers in Morningside as merciless. A Blue Security armed response officer escaped a hail of bullets unharmed when suspects opened fire when he responded to an armed robbery in Hollander Crescent on Tuesday night. Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said when the officer arrived outside the property he noticed the gate was open and that there was a white vehicle parked in the driveway, facing the road. "Just as he was about to stop, suspects opened fire on his vehicle. The officer managed to get out of his vehicle and move away from the relentless gunfire as the suspects fired shots at his vehicle, using various weapons including an automatic rifle. Shots smashed a side window and riddled the vehicle with bullet holes. The suspects then fled the scene. The officer was unharmed,” Mathios said. Mathios said the resident reported hearing the gates being derailed and a lounge glass door being broken just before the gun shots rang out. "The suspects did not manage to take anything from the premises as they had been disturbed by the armed response officer,” Mathios said. Daily News
