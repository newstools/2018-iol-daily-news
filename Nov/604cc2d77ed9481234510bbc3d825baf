Durban - The suburb of Phoenix has long been a massive problem for stray and feral cats, as there are no vets and very few people in that area who have been willing to assist said NPO Cats of Durban. Nikki Moore, theÂ co-ordinator of the volunteer group that deals with feral cats and cat colonies throughout Durban, said the establishment of a Feral Cat unit in Phoenix is a massive step forward for the organisation. "We are thrilled to announce that we have established a unit in Phoenix, which is going to work with us to Trap, Sterilize and Release (TSR) stray and feral cats in Phoenix. However, through the kind co-operation of Phoenix Animal Care and Treatment we have been placed in a position where we can establish a TSR team in that area," Moore said. Cats of Durban are still in the process of getting volunteers in Phoenix. They will train them in trapping. The team will be led by Keshnie (Cathy) Naidoo. "We look forward to our 'official launch' when the first Phoenix cats 'come off the production line' for TSR," Moore said. Daily News
