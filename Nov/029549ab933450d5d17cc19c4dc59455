Durban - In a bid to promote the City’s rich heritage and history, eThekwini Municipality’s Local History Museum will host a series of celebrations to mark 60 years of one of Durban’s oldest townships, KwaMashu. KwaMashu was established in 1958, as a result of the implementation of Group Areas act. The celebrations set to take place on November 29- 30 will kick-off with a mega event where various veterans from the township will give an account of its history, its successes and social challenges. The first event will take place at KwaMashu Indoor Sport Centre on November 29 at 9:30am. Speakers include local artistic director and entrepreneur Edmund Mhlongo, historian Rock Zuma and Obed Mbatha, one of the first residents of KwaMashu. MEC for Health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo will deliver the Andrew Zondo Lecture at 6pm. Andrew Zondo was a struggle stalwart who hailed from the same township. He was convicted and executed in 1985 after being found guilty of planting a bomb at a shopping centre in Amanzimtoti that killed five people. Dhlomo, a friend and comrade of the late Zondo, will speak about his life and times. The celebrations will end off with Amahubo Dialogue on November 30 at 10am which is aimed at promoting the rich arts and culture of the township. Daily News
