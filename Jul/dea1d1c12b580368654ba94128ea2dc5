Durban- The Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry has expressed concern at the recent devices that have been found around the city and the number of hoax calls that have been made to police. Palesa Phili, chief executive of the organisation, said they would keep monitoring the situation and keep communication channels open with all stakeholders. She said:“The Durban Chamber commends Woolworths, as it was involved in half of the incidences, for cooperating fully with the authorities and for putting in place additional protection and detection measures to ensure the safety of their employees and customers.”  Phili thanked the law enforcement agencies for the role that they played in responding to the incidents and urged them to continue with their work and bring the matter to an end very quickly as the matter could pose a danger to the city’s retail and tourism sectors. She said:“The Durban Chamber encourages businesses, their employees and the community as a whole to exercise the usual caution if you encounter unexpected devices or packages and to immediately call mall security or the centre’s management and to contact the police.” The Chamber’s comes as the city over the past two weeks having to deal with a number of devices and bomb scares over the past few weeks which has stretched police resources. The Daily News has also learnt that there have been a number of devices that have been found in Durban that date as far back as April this year which were not made public. Daily News
