Ipid spokesperson, Moses Dlamini, said a team of investigators from Ipid made their way to the scene in Geluksburg, Bergville.

While the men was driving his sheep out of the area, there was a confrontation between him and the farmer near the gate. The farmer drew his gun and shot the man in the face," Dlamini said. The injured man managed to run to a nearby shop where he asked for help. Dlamini said the police were called to the scene. A hostage negotiator was also contacted.
