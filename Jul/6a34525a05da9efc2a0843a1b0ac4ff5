This, after Cele wrote to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete requesting the national legislature investigate allegations of unethical conduct against McBride. Mbete has referred the letter to the portfolio committee on police, in recess until next month. The letter has not been made public, but it is understood Ipid senior investigator Cedric Nkabinde made the claims. In June, it was reported that Nkabinde claimed McBride instructed him and other investigators to “target and push out” former acting police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane, Lesetja Mothiba and incumbent General Khehla Sitole, while vying for the top police job. This was previously dismissed by the watchdog body, with McBride accusing Nka­binde of being one of the investigators offered jobs by the SAPS to scupper the criminal case against Phahlane. Cele’s spokesperson, Reneilwe Serero, confirmed Cele wrote the letter. “The minister is following parliamentary processes.” Serero would not be drawn on Cele’s next move, especially the possible suspension of McBride. “The portfolio committee will dictate what happens.” McBride welcomed the opportunity to formally respond to any allegations. “I have, on many occasions, brought to the attention of the portfolio committee on police and the minister acts of misconduct and criminality by senior police officers. No inquiry into them has been held. I will co-operate fully with any inquiry. These allegations are an attempt to shield senior police officers from investigation and to scupper such investigations.” Daily News
