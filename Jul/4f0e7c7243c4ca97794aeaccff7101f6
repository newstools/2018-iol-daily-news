The Daily News was alerted to the video by Chatsworth community activist Brandon Pillay. “I looked at the picture where the guy had his hand on the child’s throat,” Pillay said. “You can see the tears in the child’s eyes. It really got to me.” He said if the video was from South Africa, the authorities needed to find out if the children were still alive. “Irrespective of where it is in this world, this is still psychotic. How do you do that to an innocent child that can’t even defend itself?” he asked. Pillay said child abuse incidents were occurring more often and the children’s own families could sometimes be responsible, as in the case of BabyX, who was brutally abused and allegedly killed by her mother and grandmother. Although it is not clear if the video is local, the country has had its fair share of child abuse videos being shared. Earlier in the year, a video of a mother hitting, punching and kicking her 4-year-old daughter surfaced on social media. Alvin Brijlal, director at the Victim Outreach and Information Centre, said he did not want to open the video because it would have made him angry. “Bottom line, we have a sick society.” He said taking the parent to court and removing the child was not helping because abuse kept happening. “Guard other children, your neighbours. If a child is crying there all the time, go and pay a visit,” he said. Dumisile Nala, national executive officer for Childline SA, said they encouraged people not to circulate such videos. “Here in KwaZulu-Natal, the police have a special unit that focuses on online crimes and they are able to investigate and find the origins of the video. “They work with many stakeholders, including international partners, but the matter has to be reported to the police,” Nala explained. She said Childline encouraged communities to be vigilant and to take care of children, and circulating these videos was almost a perpetuation of the abuse. Daily News
