CPS card (old card): Sassa initially entered into a payment contract with CPS from 2012 until March 31, 2017. The Constitutional Court declared the contract invalid, but suspended the invalidity declaration for one year, until March 31, 2018, with the same terms and conditions. The court also suspended the invalidity declaration of the current contract by another six months, starting from April 1, 2018, terminating on September 31, 2018. The old Sassa card is part of the CPS contract and is being phased out. Its disadvantages are: * It allows unauthorised deductions; and * It will no longer work after September 31, 2018.
