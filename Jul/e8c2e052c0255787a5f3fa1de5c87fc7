Durban - The KwaZulu-Natal Tactical Response Team (TRT), the K9 Unit and Nsuze police officers swooped on a residence of a Montebello Hospital male nurse where two AK47 automatic assault rifles were found. This follows the 37-year-old male nurse’s resistance to be searched at the main entrance of the hospital on Monday morning. A hospital employee said the enrolled nurse at the hospital’s Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) TB unit employee was carrying a huge bag when he refused to be searched at the gate. “He was reported for that (refusal to be searched). It was suspicious because it’s a rule that bags are searched at the gate. It was at around 9am when this happened,” said the employee who is not authorised to the media. It is believed the nurse had been working at the hospital for over three years. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said a “swift response” by the law enforcement units resulted in the arrest and seizure of the two firearms and 60 rounds of ammunition. “The employee attempted to enter the hospital with a big bag but refused to be searched. He was denied entrance. Police received an intelligence about the male carrying rifles in his possession and he was intercepted whilst gaining access to his place of residence which is not far from the hospital. A search was conducted and the firearms were found in his possession. He was immediately arrested and taken to Nsuze police station for detention,” Zwane said on Tuesday. It is not clear why the nurse, who resides not far from the hospital, would want to smuggle the guns into the hospital. He said the man, who cannot be named until after he appears in court was charged for possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. He was expected to appear in kwaMaphumulo Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday. The firearms will be sent for ballistic testing to ascertain if they were used in the commission of any crimes. Daily News
