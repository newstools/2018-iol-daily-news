Durban - Members of the Provincial Drug Unit recovered drugs with a street value of R2 million in Berea, Durban. Captain Nqobile Gwala, provincial police spokesperson, said members of the unit had acted on information about drugs from Tanzania that were about to be mixed, packaged and distributed. “The team went to a flat at Canterbury Road, Berea, where a 36-year-old suspect was found in possession of heroin. The heroin drug was found in a packet as well as Paracetamol tablets in a jar. The drugs were about to be mixed and packaged to Durban areas. The total value of the recovered drugs is R600 000 but once mixed the value will be R2 million,” Gwala said. She said upon further investigation, it was established that the flat was rented in order to be used as a drug lab to manufacture drugs. The suspect will appear on Friday at the Durban Magistrate's Court on charges of manufacturing and dealing in drugs. Recently, police arrested a Nigerian man who allegedly supplied several drug runners with an assortment of narcotics in the area. The man was found in possession of one large plastic packet of methcathinone powder weighing 45.1gr, 22 pieces of rock cocaine, eight plastic packets of crystal meth, seven full moons of rock cocaine, one large white piece of rock cocaine, six plastic packets of methcathinone, 38 ecstasy tablets and six glass pipes.
