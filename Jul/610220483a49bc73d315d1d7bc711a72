The pupils, who were chosen from schools in KwaZulu-Natal as part of the Bring A Boy Child To Work campaign, were excited to learn more about their potential career path. They were taken through the charge office, met a service dog, sat on the metro police motorcycles and got to see the armoury and surveillance camera rooms. The pupils were chosen because of their strong interest in the field of policing and caught a glimpse of what it took to be a metro police officer. Nkosinathi Gumede, 16, of Thandolesizwe High School, and Sphe Vilakazi, 18, of Vuyiswa Mtolo High School, sat on the motorcycles under the supervision of Senior Constable Lumko Gcabashe. In the armoury, the pupils were taken through to the indoor shooting range where they watched an inspector take shots at a target. They were then taken to the room where firearms are kept. The importance of careful gun use was explained thoroughly to the pupils who were able to handle some of the firearms. Metro police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad said the pupils were excited to learn about being a metro police officer. “We hope that campaigns such as these will help change the minds of young people about police officers. “An inside look into the profession hopefully changed what the boys thought about policemen,” said Sewpersad. Samkelo Mthembu, 17, of Makhapha Combined School, said he thoroughly enjoyed the tour. “I would one day want to stop and arrest people who speed on the roads because it is unsafe. Today, I got to learn a lot more about some of the other duties performed by the metro police,” he said. Mpume Shangase, a programmes officer at the eThekwini Department of Community Participation, said the Bring A Boy Child To Work campaign was a way to celebrate Men’s Month and say no to the exclusion of boys in such initiatives.
