Durban- Angry community members have blocked the roads outside of the Verulam Magistrates Court as they demand justice for seven-year-old Sthembile Mila who died on Saturday at Shayamoya, near Verulam. It is alleged that Mila was playing with friends when a neighbour called and then dragged her into his house where she was allegedly raped and killed. She was then allegedly flung out a window onto the street where community members found her body. The accused is expected to make his first appearance in court on Tuesday. However, protesters do not want him to get bail and are demanding justice. The child who lost both her parents lived with her grandmother.
