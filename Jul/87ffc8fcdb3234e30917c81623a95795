Mnyandu had admitted during his trial that he would probably still be targeting young girls if it was not for the DNA evidence that linked him to rape and kidnapping cases being investigated by police in KwaDabeka and Inanda. While police in Inanda were looking for a man known as Njabulo to the victims, police in KwaDabeka were searching for a man named Vusi. In his evidence, Mnyandu had admitted using the false names to avoid being caught or being traced by his victims. However, his defence in the same breath was that the women were his girlfriends. He said the devil made him want to have sexual intercourse with them on the first day he met them. He blamed his hot-blooded nature, saying that he met the victims on different occasions, expressed his feelings for them, had consensual sex and never saw them again. His version was challenged by state State advocate Krishen Shah, who argued it was hard to believe that a virgin would allow a stranger to have sex with her in such a disgusting public place and then later open a case of rape against him. Shah had argued it was highly unlikely that so many women would open rape charges against him and questioned what the women would have gained by laying false cases against him, especially if it was true that they were his girlfriends. Some of his victims and their families and Mnyandu’s relatives packed the courtroom for yesterday’s judgment. Mnyandu pleaded not guilty to seven counts of rape and eight counts of kidnapping relating to incidents from 2010 to 2016. The evidence by all the victims that he was violent was collaborated by doctors, who had testified and concluded that the rapist had used extreme force. Judge Mokgere Masipa found that the state had proved Mnyandu’s guilt beyond all reasonable doubt. Sentencing is expected in September. Daily News
