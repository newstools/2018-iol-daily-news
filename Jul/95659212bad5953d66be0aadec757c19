Durban - An off-duty policeman heading home spotted a car engine on a riverbank in Inanda on Tuesday. The find led Inanda police to raid hot spots used by several car theft syndicates .operating in the back yards of houses and remote areas. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson said the policeman stationed at Durban Central was on his way home when he found the engine abandoned at Ezihlabathini area. "The officer took the engine and brought it to the police station.  When police checked the numbers on the engine they found out that it belonged to a car that was stolen in the Bellair area in June," she said. Gwala added that no arrests had been made but  Inanda SAPS had intensified their operations in the area and conducted regular visits to shops that deal with second-hand goods to make sure that they comply in terms of the Second Hand Goods Act. Inanda police also located a car chop shop operating from an abandoned warehouse in the Lindelani area. Here they found a VW Polo that had been cut up into pieces. Gwala said the Polo had been stolen in Hartley Road, Overport in June. "It is alleged that the victim parked his black VW Polo in Hartley road. The next day he received a call from his vehicle tracker company informing him that his vehicle had been stolen. Investigations are still continuing. No arrests were made," Gwala said.
