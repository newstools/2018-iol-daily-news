Durban - KwaZulu-Natal police say they have put a major dent in the drug trade in Pinetown after arresting a Nigerian man who allegedly supplied several drug runners with an assortment of narcotics in the area. Police spokesman, Colonel Thulani Zwane said members of the Drug and Firearm Unit staked out the area of Dales Avenue opposite the McDonalds restaurant this week after receiving information on an alleged drug distributor. They put together a sting operation and arrested a 31-year-old man on Tuesday night. Zwane said the man was allegedly found in possession of one large plastic packet of methcathinone powder weighing 45.1gr, 22 pieces of rock cocaine, eight plastic packets of crystal meth, seven full moons of rock cocaine, one large white piece of rock cocaine, six plastic packets of methcathinone, 38 ecstasy tablets and six glass pipes. The drugs are valued at approximately R29 000. The man was taken to Pinetown police station where he was charged for possessing and dealing in narcotics. He is expected to appear in court soon. The arrest comes less than a week after the same unit arrested a 29-year-old alleged drug dealer in Amanzimtoti and seized R300 000 worth of drugs. At the time police said the alleged Amanzimtoti drug dealer may be linked to other dealers in Durban. Zwane said that the scourge of drug abuse was ravaging communities and contributing to the crime epidemic that could "soon culminate to a national crisis" "Unfortunately this pandemic does not discriminate between race, gender, age or creed. It engulfs anybody willing to partake in it. We have all witnessed the dire consequences which come with the use of drugs. Families have been left broken up, young kids leaving home, professionals leaving their employment, young girls turning into prostitution, boys turning into crime, the list is endless," he said.
