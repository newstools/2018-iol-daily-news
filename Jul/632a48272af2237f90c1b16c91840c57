Durban - Fifty-seven per cent of people are in favour of renaming Higginson Highway and Chatsworth stadium after the late Minority Front leader, Amichand Rajbansi. This is according to a Facebook Poll run by the Daily News on Monday following the MF reigniting the call for the highway and Chatsworth Stadium renamed after Rajbansi. The MF requested the name change in 2012 and 2013 after the former leader’s death. Then-councillor, Prakash Dasarath, worked on the matter in the eThekwini council but progress was slow. A new call to rename the sites after Rajbansi was made this week.  While the majority of people who participated in the Facebook poll was supportive of the renaming, many felt that it would be a waste of money. Some said that the money spent on renaming the sites should instead be used for improvements of hospitals or making the Higginson Highway safer In an interview with the POST newspaper in 2012, she said: "Chatsworth Stadium was the brain child of our former leader. He played a significant role in establishing the stadium for the community.  At the time of negotiating the development of a stadium, Mr Rajbansi did not receive any assistance from local council. He took it upon himself to fight for the construction of a stadium and opened a development fund. He invited the public to contribute towards the fund to ensure that the dream became a reality".  Councillor Jonathan Annipen of MF said they circled a petition in Chatsworth and captured thousands of signatures to get the name of Higginson Highway and the Chatsworth Stadium changed to honour Rajbansi. “Rajbansi lived in Chatsworth throughout his political career,” Annipen said.”It’s only fair to give recognition to someone who dedicated his life to the people.”  Daily News
