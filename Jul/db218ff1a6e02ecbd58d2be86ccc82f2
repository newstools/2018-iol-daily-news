“The investigation will establish the cause of the crash and if it is found that the driver or the owner of the taxi is responsible then the law will take its course,” said department spokesperson Mluleki Mntungwa. According to Mntungwa, the investigation will determine if the operator was authorised to carry pupils. The pupils were on their way home from school on Monday when their taxi crashed into a light pole on Adelaide Tambo (Kensington) Drive. A child broke an arm, said Kyle van Reenen, a Crisis Medical spokesperson. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: “The driver fled the scene, but a case of reckless and negligent driving has been opened.” No information has been given on the taxi company involved. However, the Department of Education warned operators that they would not be treated differently to anyone else regarding traffic laws. “There are no special rules for taxi drivers. They have to follow the rules of the road - no special conditions,” said department spokesperson Sihle Mlotshwa. Neither the department of Education nor Transport mentioned any policies or programmes addressing the prevention of accidents, but urged parents to take the responsibility of ensuring safe school transport for their children. “It is the responsibility of the parents to ensure that the pupils use safe and affordable transport,” said Mntungwa. Vee Gani, chairperson of the South Durban branch of the KZN Parents’ Association, urged parents to “not be afraid to ask questions” to ensure the taxi operators and owners have all the proper documentation and authorisation to transport their children. Van Keenen also advised parents to ensure their children had proper identification with them at all times. Daily News
