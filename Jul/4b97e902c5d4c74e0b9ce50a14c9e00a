Le Roux, a 15-year resident of Kloof, and local authorities found Nala after following a trail of blood from her bedroom to the living room. Intruders stabbed the dog in the neck with a piece of the ­entrance gate in Friday’s incident. Nala’s barks awakened Le Roux early that morning, but four intruders were already at the entrance of her bedroom. Armed with a knife, the robbers demanded money and other valuables from Le Roux. They forced her to lie face-down on the bed. “They gagged me, placed a duvet cover over my head and tied my arms behind my back. The ordeal lasted for about an hour,” she said. Authorities arrived quickly after being alerted by Le Roux’s neighbour who heard her screams. With her hands tied behind her back, Le Roux said she opened her bedroom window with her head and screamed for help.  The robbers got away. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “At knifepoint, they took a TV set, wallet, other belongings and fled with the complainant’s red Hyundai i10.” Le Roux is seeing a trauma counsellor. Nala, who now has stitches on her neck, refuses to go into Le Roux’s bedroom. Le Roux has had the gate fixed, but plans to have sensor beams installed to deter other intruders. A neighbourhood watch patroller who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there had been at least one home robbery daily in the Kloof area this month. Blue Security spokesperson Andreas Mathios warned residents to call their security company or police if they heard dogs barking. The Hyundai i10 was found but Gwala said no arrests had been made. Police were still ­investigating. Daily News
