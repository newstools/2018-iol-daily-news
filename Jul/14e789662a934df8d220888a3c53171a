Durban - Bonginkosi Khanyile the Economic Freedom Fighters activist who allegedly led violent #FeesMustFall protests is to plead guilty to four charges he has been charged with. The charges include public violence, two counts of failing to comply with a police order and possession of a dangerous weapon. The Daily News learned that lawyers from Johannesburg were flown to Durban from Johannesburg by the EFF to represent Khanyile after his lawyer, Avinash Bissesur told the court he could no longer represent him on Wednesday.

It came after the court was shown a damning 40-minute police which allegedly showed Khanyile hurling stones and bricks at police on the day of his arrest on September 27, 2016. The new legal team flown to Durban on Thursday negotiated that Khanyile would plead guilty to four of the 13 counts he has been charged with. It is expected that he would make a formal plea next month. The revelation happened today at the Durban Regional Court and was announced by his new lawyer, Advocate Danie Combrink. This brings to a close a dramatic case that has been dragging on for the best of two years and led Khanyile to change lawyers numerous times, much to the annoyance of Magistrate Siphiwe Hlophe who warned that Khanyile might have to represent himself.
