Durban - Strike action at the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board has meant that all shark nets on the province's coast have been lifted. The board announced the measure ahead of a strike by workers planned to start on Friday July 27. It said there had been in ongoing wage and other demand negotiations with the South African Liberated Public Sector Workers Union (Salipswu) since early December 2017. "This matter has been heard at the CCMA on a number of occasions unfortunately without resolution," the board said in a statement. "The organisation has been served with a notice to strike by the union which will take effect on Friday July27. "The duration of this strike action is unknown at this time and in an effort to ensure zero environmental impact all shark safety gear at protected beaches along the KZN coast has been temporarily removed," it added. The board requested bathers to adhere to lifeguards' recommendations and instructions at the province's beaches. The Sharks Board said it would continue to negotiate with the union in an effort to speedily resolve these matters. The Independent on Saturday
