Durban - A Pietermaritzburg police dog was run over by a truck while attempting to apprehend a suspect on the N3 near Market Road on Friday. One man was killed and two others were also injured during a shooting incident. Russel Meiring, ER 24 ambulance service spokesperson, said paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene to find a taxi covered with bullet holes, parked on the fast lane of the N3. He said three men were found lying in the centre median. "Upon closer inspection, paramedics found that one man had sustained numerous gunshot wounds. He was in a critical condition. A second man had sustained a gunshot wound to his leg. The third man was found with dog-bite wounds to his arm and leg," Meiring said. He said paramedics treated the men at the scene. "While treating the critically injured man, paramedics found that his vital signs rapidly diminished. CPR and further advanced life support interventions were immediately initiated. Unfortunately, after some time, no vital signs returned and the man was declared dead," Meiring said. The seriously injured man was transported to a nearby provincial hospital while the third man was taken into police custody. The KwaZulu Natal Police media centre did not respond to email queries. The South African Community Crime Watch (SACCW) in KwaZulu Natal said the incident was related to a stock theft incident.  It is alleged that three cows had been stolen. Details around the incident and how the dog was run over were sketchy on Friday morning. The SACCW group said the suspects were intercepted while travelling in a Toyota minibus taxi on the N3 Durban bound near Market Road where the shoot out ensued. Daily News
