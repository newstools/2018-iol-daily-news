Durban- Nine-year-old Mfundo Hlophe who had been missing since last week Thursday has been found and reunited with his family in the Mfekayi Reserve, north of KZN. KZN police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed the boy's safe return. Hlophe had gone missing on Thursday last week after his grandmother Thembi Gama had sent him and two others to get water from a neighbours tap. “We always send him there to get water and he was not by himself so we did not think much about it,” said Gama. It was only when the boy did not return that she started worrying. “When the two others he had gone out with returned I was really worried about where Mfundo would have gone,” said Gama. She added that they searched for him everywhere but could not find him. Hlophe was later found roaming around by a woman who then asked him to show her where he lived. "Mfundo told us that the woman found him lost on the side of the tar road which is not that far from here, the lady asked him what he was doing there and he explained that he was lost," said Gama. They then searched for Hlophe's home and found it. Gama said she thanked the lady for helping in the safe return of her grandchild. Daily News
