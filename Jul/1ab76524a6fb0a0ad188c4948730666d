DURBAN - A 40-year-old Durban man is lucky to be alive after he fell off a cliff while trimming trees in Kloof on Thursday. The man had been employed to assist a Winston Park homeowner trim a set of trees. Blue Security spokesperson Andreas Mathios said the man was not familiar with the terrain. He apparently dodged a falling tree branch when he slipped and fell down the cliff. Mathios said he was impressed with the professionalism shown by the rescue teams when he arrived on scene. Mathios said a plan was plotted on how to retrieve the man from the bottom of the cliff. "Although these are experienced rescue teams each scenario has its own challenges. They used a rope system to climb down about 60 meters to where the man was. They attacked a pulley system and hoisted him up. They had to carry him from the edge of the cliff on an upward slope some 50meters to stable ground," Mathios said. The man suffered from a broken arm and lacerations to his body. Mathios said there are two rescue teams in Durban.  The Durban metro police and SAPS search and rescue team which are assisted by volunteers from Rescue Tech. The paramedics that assisted was from ER24 and Netcare 911. A Blue Security guard watched over the vehicles while the rescue was in place. Daily News
