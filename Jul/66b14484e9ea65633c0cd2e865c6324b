Durban - Police busted a hydroponic dagga lab and arrested five dealers in Durban on Thursday. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a KwaZulu Natal police spokesperson, said police found dagga with a street value of more than R61 000 in the Bluff and Umbilo, south of Durban. Police officers who are dealing with drugs and illegal firearms acted on information about drugs at Bluff area on Thursday night. The members proceeded to Worthling Avenue in Bluff where they spotted a gold Etios vehicle with two men inside. "They were searched and 100grams of hydroponic dagga was found. On further investigation, the members proceeded to Sphiwe Zuma Avenue, Glenwood at Umbilo. Three more suspects were arrested after they were found in possession of 308,9 grams of hydroponic dagga," Zwane said. All five suspects were charged accordingly and will appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Friday. Hydroponics is the art of growing plants without soil. When most people think of growing marijuana hydroponically, they think of growing their plants with their roots suspended directly into water with absolutely no growing medium. The sale of this type of dagga has become popular with several undercover labs being busted in the past year by police. Daily News
