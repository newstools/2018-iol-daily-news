Durban- A task team has been formed to deal with the service delivery protests that have become a norm in the province  Mxolisi Kaunda, MEC for Transport and Safety and Community liaisons said on Tuesday. The committee will include the MEC for Education  Mthandeni Dlungwane, Ravi Pillay from Human Settlements and Public Works among others. The MEC held a media briefing on Tuesday in the wake of several protests, the latest occurring on the N2 highway where protesters burnt tyres and disrupted traffic going into Durban. Kaunda said they wanted to manage protests appropriately and make sure protests are lawful. "We want to, therefore, declare a war on these illegal protests," he said adding that protests divert attention and resources away from catching criminals. He said in the previous financial year, there were 530 public protests according to police records. In the past four months, there have been more than 270 illegal protests with some choking major transport arteries like the N3, N2 freeway and Van Reenen pass among others. Protests have been wide-spread in Durban with uMlazi, Bottlebrush and Chesterville some of the areas with major protests People who are arrested at these illegal protests will be liable for a fine of up to R2 000 and face jail terms. Protest leaders were also liable for damage that was caused during protests. Police also took flack as they were not decisive enough when dealing with protests. With elections around the corner, Kaunda said political parties will be using public issues to try and score political points."We are not a banana republic," he said. Daily News
