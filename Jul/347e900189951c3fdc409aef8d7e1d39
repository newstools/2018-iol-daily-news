Durban- Two Phoenix pensioners and a woman are being treated for smoke inhalation after their home caught alight on Thursday. The Phoenix Fire Department and emergency were at the scene in Earlmanor Place, Trenance Park. Annastashia Naidu, a spokesperson for a private security company Platinum Asset protection, said they had seen smoke billowing out from the house from their offices nearby and rushed to the scene to assist. Naidu said a room of the house was completely destroyed by the fire. "A neighbouring home which is semi-detached to the house was also partially damaged by the fire. It is alleged that the cause of the fire could have been an electrical fault.  The family are still traumatised and were unable to speak about the ordeal yet," Naidu said. Neighbours heard the family scream for help and rushed to the house which is a cul-de-sac. Neighbours then alerted security guards and the fire department.  Details as to what transpired were sketchy on Thursday morning. Glen Naidoo, of KZN Vip Unit security, said paramedics treated a 69-year-old woman and 79-year-old man at the scene for trauma. "They were not physically injured but a bit shook up and stressed about the incident. They have been experiencing electrical problems in the house. I cannot confirm the cause of the fire," Naidoo said. He added that they will assess the damages and see how best the community can help the elderly couple regain from the incident. Daily News
