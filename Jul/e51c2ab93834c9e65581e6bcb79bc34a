Durban - The Minority Front (MF) has reignited their call to get Higginson Highway and Chatsworth Stadium renamed in honour of their late MF leader, Amichand Rajbansi. The MF requested the name change in 2012 and 2013 after the former leader’s death. Then councillor, Prakash Dasarath, worked on the matter in the eThekwini council but progress was slow. Shameen Thakur-Rajbansi, MF leader, said Amichand was founder and leader of the MF. “It's time now for our new government leadership to be fair and inclusive and give the late Honorable Mr Amichand Rajbansi the honour he really deserves, that is, to rename the Higginson Highway to the Amichand Rajbansi Highway and the stadium to the Amichand Rajbansi Stadium,” Thakur-Rajbansi said. Councillor Jonathan Annipen of MF said they circled a petition in Chatsworth and captured thousands of signatures to get the name of Higginson Highway and the Chatsworth Stadium changed to honour Rajbansi. “Rajbansi lived in Chatsworth throughout his political career,” Annipen said.”It’s only fair to give recognition to someone who dedicated his life to the people.” Visit our poll on our Daily News Facebook page and let us whether you support the changes or not.
