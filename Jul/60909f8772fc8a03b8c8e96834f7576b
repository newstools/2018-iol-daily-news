Gary Michaux, general manager of the lodge, said the weather was lovely yesterday, with clear skies. “Temperatures are around 5°C and snow is melting but there is still lots on the mountain tops,” Michaux said. He added that no snowfall was predicted for yesterday. He said that there had been an accident on a very icy Sani Pass. Dylan Meyrick, of IPSS Medical Rescue, said a couple from Ballito ­escaped with minor injuries after their vehicle slid over a ledge at Sani Pass. IPSS Medical Rescue members were on the pass and saw the incident. “About three kilometres from the top, they lost control in icy conditions and their vehicle slid over the edge. About 100m down, the vehicle was stopped by a rock and the couple was able to exit the vehicle with minor injuries,” said Meyrick. He added that IPSS members helped the couple to the road, where Berg Protection Services members arrived to continue the rescue and recovery. South African Weather Service forecaster Stacey Colborne said the weather in KZN should start warming up from Wednesday. Clear skies were predicted from today, she said. Up until Wednesday, temperatures would be between 12°C and 19°C. Colborne added that snow had fallen along the Drakensberg, in areas such as Giant’s Castle and Underberg. “Very light snow fell in those areas and it would have melted by now,” she said. Colborne said that areas near the snowfall - including Giant’s Castle, Van Reenen, Underberg and Kokstad - had experienced maximum temperatures of between 10°C and 12°C over the weekend. Daily News
