Durban - The Inchanga Police station continues to work as normal despite a fire destroying an office on Tuesday. Dennis Govender, Divisional Commander of the fire department in the western region, said they were called out to the police station just after 6am. Govender said when they arrived smoke was billowing out of an office block. "The office has a wooden flooring. It was smoke logged. When we investigated we found the possible cause of the fire to be an overheated computer box. There were no injuries reported. There was no arson suspected," Govender said. Firefighters ventilated the room and handed over the scene to the police for further investigation. Govender advised people to switch off and unplug items at home or in their offices that were not being used. "The public should take the necessary precautions to ensure their homes and businesses are safeguarded against fires,"he added. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, confirmed that a fire did occur in one of the offices at the police station. Mbhele said the fire was restricted to one office. "An enquiry will be opened to establish the cause of the fire," she said. Daily News
