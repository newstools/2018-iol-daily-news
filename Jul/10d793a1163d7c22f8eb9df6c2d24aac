It, too, will be a world first. She swam the gruelling 60km Kai’wi Channel, in Hawaii, in almost 18 hours last July to highlight the problem of plastic pollution, later launching her own non-profit organisation, Breathe, which aims to eliminate throw-away plastic pollution through education “and doing crazy swims to highlight the issue”. Now Ferguson, backed by a team of four, will be undertaking another adventure: a staged swim series along the southern coast of Mozambique and northern KwaZulu-Natal. The 100km challenge, to be undertaken over six days, will involve swimming from Ponta Dobela to Sodwana, with stops along the way. “We are expecting great winds, so it is going to be a challenge,” she said yesterday. And yes, there probably would be sharks and she would be excited to see them. The big swim will be documented, and a seven-part documentary series will be released on the Breath Facebook page, “showing our findings and sharing the challenges and amazing things we find on the way”, said Ferguson, a retired competitive swimmer. Ferguson’s team will be in charge of the route and water safety, will keep her fuelled, happy, motivated and warm, will photograph her swim and give her massages. There is also a bigger team behind the scenes planning her nutrition to ensure she gets enough calories to fuel her swim. Daily News
