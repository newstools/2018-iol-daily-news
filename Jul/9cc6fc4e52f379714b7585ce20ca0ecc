Durban - The eThekwini Municipality is sitting with over 100 broken down buses at the Ntuzuma bus depot. During a recent oversight inspection at the depot, the Democratic Alliance found over 100 buses that have not been in operation for over a month now. Martin Meyer, DA whip on human settlements and infrastructure, said a meeting with the depot operations manager, Caleb Gcaba, revealed that the upkeep and maintenance of the buses was a competence of the Durban City Fleet. The party had since written to the head of city fleet, Ben Ngwenya and City Treasurer Krish Kumar to seek clarity on the state on the city’s fleet. The Daily News has seen the letter. “The current shortage of buses has a negative impact on commuters that travel to KwaMashu, Umhlanga, La Lucia, and Newlands East. "A recent conversation with a resident of Newlands East revealed that a woman found herself stranded when a 18:00 bus from West Mead did not arrive at the set time with no prior notice to commuters. "The bus situation is going from bad to worse with the city not providing clarity on when this will be remedied,” Meyer said on Tuesday. He said the situation not only has an impact on the productivity of the city’s economy, but with school holidays about to come to an end it may be to the detriment of scholars who travel far to attend schools, since it is a more convenient and cheaper means of transportation. EThekwini has not responded to emailed questions by the time of publishing. Daily News
