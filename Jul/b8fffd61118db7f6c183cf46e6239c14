John Loos, FNB household and property analyst, said the projects would address a lot of apartheid-era legacy housing problems. This is after the Daily News reported last week that eThekwini Municipality had tabled a report to its human settlements and infrastructure committee meeting on the issue. The meeting revealed plans to build more than 8000 units at various places around the city. Some of the areas include Warwick Avenue, uMgeni Road and sites that fall under North Beach - a bone of contention for some. The projects aimed to accommodate low- to middle-income households which earned between R1500 and R15000 a month, providing rental or co-operative housing options for them. The DA has raised concerns about the proposed developments. One is about the proposed North Beach site being near to high value residential and commercial sites, another that the City should be looking at refurbishing many derelict buildings in the city. Loos said he supported the plan because RDP houses normally located on the outskirts of cities involve high transport costs for poor people to travel to the inner city. The proposal could be successful as long as it was well managed. Daily News
