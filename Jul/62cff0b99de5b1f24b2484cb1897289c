Durban - There has been an outcry from the public after a baby girl was abandoned in a toilet at Addington Hospital in Durban in June. Colonel Thembeka Mbele, provincial police spokesperson, said the Durban Central Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit is appealing to the community for assistance in a child abandonment case they are investigating. “It is alleged that on June 28, 2018 at 7am a baby girl child was found abandoned in  Addington Hospital toilet by a nurse who then informed the police. The child is baby girl plus minus a month old. She was covered with pink blanket and is in good health status,” Mbele said. She said Durban Central police have appealed to the community who might help in locating the mother of the child. Anyone with the information of the biological mother is urged to contact Detective Sergeant Buhle Masondo on 031 325 4142 or 0718759834 or Crime Stop number on 08600 10111. Meanwhile, on Facebook, users vented out their frustrations at the police statement: Samantha Webb: What about the child's father? Why is he not equally responsible for abandoning her? Henrietta Langeveldt-Alberts: Let's not blame the mother for her actions until she is found and can explain. She could be a victim of abuse, or have one of many terrible reasons. I'm not condoning her actions, but at least she didn't leave the baby in a rubbish bin or public toilet. Find her, find out why she did what she did, and then, and ONLY then, judge her. Summer Marshall: Such a sad thing. I think there should be more education on these types of things and different situations and what mothers in any kind of situation can do. Oh and PROTECTION IS FREE at local clinics Sekgopi Senior: This is foolishness, why should u carry a child for 9 months then throw away. Regardless of whatever situation people must stop this bad things Daily News
