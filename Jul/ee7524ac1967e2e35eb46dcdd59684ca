Durban - The efforts of police hostage negotiators have been lauded after a kidnap victim was found alive and four men arrested for the crime that occurred in Chatsworth last week. Police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said the officers worked tirelessly to ensure that the victim's safety was not compromised at any time. She said the man was taken on June 29 from the Chatsworth suburb of Westcliff. "The man was approached by four suspects who forcefully took him away. A case was reported to the police and a search was conducted. Durban hostage negotiators were also alerted and assist with the search. 'The suspects demanded ransom cash from the family of the victim before they can release him as he was kept hostage at an unknown place," she said. Gwala said the negotiators intervened and negotiated with the four men. "Ransom money was also demanded from the victim’s brother in Uganda and $1000 was deposited into one of the suspect’s account. Umhlali K9 unit, special task force and national intervention unit also joined the search and two suspects were arrested. "They were found in KwaDukuza. Upon further investigation, two more suspects were arrested and one of them was found in possession of a firearm believed to be used  during the kidnapping," Gwala said. Gwala said Durban hostage negotiators played a big role in getting information and identifying suspects as well in this case. Information was given to K9 unit and detectives who managed to trace and arrest the suspects. The victim was kept in a house at Mandeni and later he managed to escape with visible injuries. She added that the four men would be appearing in court soon on charges of kidnapping. Daily News
