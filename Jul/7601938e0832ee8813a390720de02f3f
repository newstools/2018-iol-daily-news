“The BRICS Youth Summit presents an opportunity to accelerate youth development in line with the National Development Plan Vision 2030, which articulates that information and communications technology will underpin the development of a dynamic and connected information society, and a vibrant knowledge economy that is more inclusive and prosperous,” said Sifiso Mtsweni, NYDA executive chair,as he addressed media in Pretoria. “As government continues to roll out migration from analogue to digital broadcasting transmission, the NYDA is also seized with co-ordinating a national strategy for young people to ensure they benefit from such an opportunity.” He said the BRICS Youth Summit, to be convened under the theme “Radical Economic Transformation - Making the New Development Bank Work for the Youth”, also “crafts a paradigm that is mutually beneficial to all five nations”, by impacting on the lives of citizens. The youth summit takes place from July 15 to 16 in Bela-Bela, Limpopo. African News Agency (ANA)
