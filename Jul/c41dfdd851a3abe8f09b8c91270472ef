Each year bean sprouts are planted outside the Gold Circle offices and named after the horses competing in the race. According to tradition, the horse whose name appears on the bean that grows the tallest will win the race. Tilbury Fort was in the lead this week, followed closely by reserve runner Pack Leader and Coral Fever. The plants looked far healthier than this time last year, just days before the famous horse race, making it easier to “see” who was in the lead. Crowd Pleaser, a reserve runner, and Abashiri were leaning sideways. Meanwhile, July fever is heating up in the city, despite the cold front that blew into the province this week. The hospitality suites at Greyville Racecourse are being prepared, final deliveries are being made and tickets are selling fast. Ken Tweddell, Gold Circle’s marketing manager, said everything was on track and this would be the best race ever. He said he was expecting a fantastic crowd and deejays to keep them entertained. “One of the changes this year is that judging for the fashion will not be on the racecourse as usual, but will be at the parade ring behind the grandstand,” he said.
