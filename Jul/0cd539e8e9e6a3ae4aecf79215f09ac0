Durban -  Thousands of people descended on Ulundi on Wednesday for an inaugural imbizo called by King Goodwill Zwelithini on the contentious issue on plans to repeal the Ingonyama Trust which administers all communal land in KwaZulu-Natal on behalf the King. The imbizo was in response to a high-level Panel on the Assessment of Key Legislation and Fundamental Change led by former president, Kgalema Motlanthe that recommended that the Ingonyama Trust Act should be repealed or amended and the Ingonyama Trust should be collapsed and the land given back to the state. This is what we know so far about the Imbizo.                               Daily News
