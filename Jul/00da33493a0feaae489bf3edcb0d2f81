Durban - Police officers, caught on camera grappling with an Uber driver at the King Shaka International Airport, will not face disciplinary action. The statement was made by national police spokesperson, Brigadier Vish Naidoo. Naidoo was responding to questions put forward by the Daily News, after three video clips emerged on social media showing police officers getting into an altercation with a driver.  It is alleged that the driver arrived at the airport and wanted to park in the airport's parking lot, while he waited for a passenger. Police officers obstructed the man and told him that he was not allowed to park in the parking lot. The officers then try to place the man under arrest. They claim that his vehicle has false registration plate information. The driver then asks to speak to a black policeman, arguing that a black officer will be able to understand him better. In the third video, the officers then pushes the man to the ground in an attempt to put handcuffs on his wrists. Speaking to the Daily News, Naidoo said after reviewing the footage, they decided the officers did not act outside their bounds. "We conducted an inquiry into the matter and the feeling is that the police officers have used minimum force in that incident," he said. Daily News
