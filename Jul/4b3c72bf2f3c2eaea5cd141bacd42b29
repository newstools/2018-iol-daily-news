Durban - A planned visit by President Cyril Ramaphosa to Chatsworth on Friday is in doubt, despite local ANC organisations working behind the scenes to ensure it goes ahead. Ramaphosa’s expected visit is part of the ANC’s nationwide Thuma Mina (Send Me) campaign. A senior member of the ANC branch in Chatsworth, who was not authorised to speak to the media, said the meeting would go ahead and Ramaphosa would have direct interaction with relevant stakeholders that have been invited from across a broad spectrum of organisations. The meeting, which would be held at the Kharwastan Civic Centre, was not intended to be a mass meeting and would be by invite only. However, a spokesperson for the Presidency, Khusela Diko, said that Ramaphosa’s visit to Durban was not listed in the government diary. Telephone calls and messages to ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe and KwaZulu-Natal convener Mike Mabuyakhulu and co-ordinator Sihle Zikalala went unanswered. Ramaphosa's planned visit comes hot on the heels of DA leader Musi Maimane’s address at the Christian Revival Centre Church in Chatsworth on Sunday, where he stated that churches play a vital role in shaping and healing our communities. It also comes amid heightened tensions between the Indian and black communities following racist utterances by people in both communities. The ANC website explains that the Thuma Mina Campaign is about the ANC reconnecting with the people through activities that improve their lives and solve their problems. The campaign is also a way to work in partnership with the community role-players to address people’s problems and community challenges. Daily News
