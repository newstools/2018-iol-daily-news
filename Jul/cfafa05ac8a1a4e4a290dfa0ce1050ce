An estimated R160 million will be spent directly on products and services, ranging from transport, accommodation, restaurants and hospitality, to fashion and entertainment, according to a survey conducted at last year’s Vodacom Durban July. Emphasising the across-the-board value that the Vodacom Durban July has on the local economy was the President of the Durban Chamber Of Commerce, Musa Makhunga. He said the event is one of South Africa’s most respected sporting events and has become a highlight for both South Africans and overseas visitors, who flock to Durban to witness what has become known as 'Africa’s Greatest Horseracing Event'.  "An event of this nature brings an array of socio-economic benefits to the local economy and besides for the over R150 million injected into the local economy, the event produces annualised employment of 320 and government taxes of R10 million,” Makhunga said. Meanwhile, Gold Circle has confirmed that the annual competition to spotlight the best hospitality venue will continue this year, with judges scouting all the venues before deciding on the winners of this prestigious prize. The main stage area, that is the focus of the fashion programme, will give way to a number of top-selling music acts as the day wears on, ensuring that Africa’s Greatest Horseracing event ends on a high note.
