 Modular libraries are 230m2, consisting of a study area that can accommodate up to 100 people at a time and also offer free access to the internet. They house 3000 library materials including tertiary textbooks as well as resources that assist with learner support.  The library would have contributed towards bolstering literacy levels and providing much-needed access to information in Ward 11 and surrounding areas.  “We call upon all communities to honour and protect government facilities, these facilities are meant to service everyone in the community both young and old. The Nokweja modular library was meant to assist the community and the children of that area to advance their knowledge and afford them access to information. Access to information is a constitutional right for every South African, we build libraries to fulfil this mandate and uplift rural communities. We urge the community to isolate these criminals that have done this and work with law enforcement agencies to apprehend them” said MEC Bongiwe Sithole-Moloi.  Daily News
