Durban -  Armed response officer arrested an armed intruder who had held up a Bluff resident at knifepoint in her home on Wednesday. Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said the armed response officer responded to the scene of the home invasion at a cottage on a property in Marine Drive at around 9.45pm. “We received a call from the resident in the main house that there was an intruder on the property.  He had held up a domestic worker who lives in a cottage at the back of the property,” Mathios said. “According to the domestic worker, the suspect had forced his way into her home through the main door to the cottage and had attempted to stab her with a knife. She managed to successfully defend herself with a broomstick and escape the attack unharmed,” Mathios said. “Our armed response officer responded swiftly to the property and arrested suspect who was still on the premises and armed with a knife,” Mathios said. Brighton Beach SAPS attended the scene of the crime. Meanwhile, balaclava-clad armed robbers held up a security guard at business premises in Musgrave and made off with computers in the early hours of Thursday. Mathios said a gang of six suspects, two of them armed with firearms, forced their way onto the property in Windmill Road and held up the security guard at gunpoint. The incident occurred at around 5.50am. “The gang derailed the driveway gate and held up the security guard and then proceeded to kick in the back door of the building to gain entry. They forced the security guard to sit under a desk while they removed computers and a flat screen monitor. The suspects loaded the goods into their vehicle and fled the scene,” Mathios said. Berea police attended the scene of the crime. Daily News
