Durban - A Durban born woman was named winner of the recent Capsicum Culinary Studio Winter Wonderland Cake Competition held in Durban. Priyanka Govender, 27, beat two other contestants in a bake-off final to win first prize of an all-inclusive full-time Diploma in Patisserie bursary from Capsicum worth R98 000. Govender made a five layered velvet cake, covered in a decadent cream cheese icing, finished off with a dark chocolate ganache drip, edible flowers, toasted almonds, blueberries and strawberries. She was born and raised in Durban but now lives in Johannesburg and works as a radiation therapist. "I was pleasantly surprised and shocked! Producing a cake in two hours was stressful but I enjoyed every moment of the bake off," she said. The principal of KZN’s Capsicum Culinary Studio campus and one of the judges, Julia Greenaway, said: “Priyanka's cake was delicious and her own recipe. The taste combinations were balanced and the overall aesthetics were appealing and had obvious talent applied. She had good time management, and a clean approach to her styling and the way she operated in the kitchen.” About Govender: Where did you learn to bake? My mum is a self-taught baker who taught me to bake when I was 16 and my love for the hobby has just flourished. Who would you like to bake a cake for and what would it be? Sofia Vergara (from the TV series Modern Family) - loud, in your face, beautiful and she has an affinity for cake! I would make her a Tres Leches cake, flavoured with rum and toasted coconut. Your cake hero? Buddy Valastro - his creations are innovative and out of the box. Your dream? To have my own patisserie and, once I have completed my studies with Capsicum Culinary Studio, I will be working towards that dream. Daily News
