And when he takes to the sea for a 300km ocean swim along the coast of Mozambique, Gaven Sinclair will overcome his fear of the ocean. “I am busy designing a swim suit with special fins for my outer forearms and head unit,” he said in a message from Ponta Malongane in Mozambique, where he is now based. If he manages to complete the ocean challenge, he will have completed the longest triathlon in the world. He has already cycled unsupported across Africa, from Cape to Cairo, using peddle power to cover 10039km in 261 days. And then, setting out from St Lucia, where he was living at the time, he embarked on an unsupported 4 000km endurance run through four African countries in 230 days. Sinclair, a motivational speaker and life coach in health and wellness, who is planning to start an extreme adventure business in Mozambique, is an ambassador for the charity Missing Children South Africa, raising awareness of the organisation wherever he goes. “A child goes missing every five hours in South Africa.” Check him out on: https://www.facebook.com/gavensinclair73/ Daily News
