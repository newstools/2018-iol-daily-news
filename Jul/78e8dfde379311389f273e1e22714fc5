Durban - On Monday the South African Association for Marine Biological Research (SAAMBR) bid a sad goodbye to Daisy, one of their Cape Fur seals. In a statement, Saambr said Daisy was a calm, inquisitive and gentle seal, who joined them from the Two Oceans Aquarium in 2007. “Daisy, who was 23 years old, recently started to show signs of her age. She had to undergo surgery to remove a blockage in her large intestine, and in spite of intensive care following the operation, her intestines failed to regain their full function. Multiple organ systems became affected and she was not comfortable,” the statement said. Daisy was euthanised after much discussion and deliberation with the veterinary team and international experts in seal care. It became clear that she was not going to recover. “A playful seal, Daisy loved being sprayed with water and playing with her toys, over which she was very possessive. Over the years she crept into our hearts with her gentle nature, and she was a favourite with our visitors. She was a wonderful seal to work with, always co-operative and willing to please,” the statement said. Daily News
