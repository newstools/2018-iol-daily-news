The committee is responsible for the preparations of a series of events to celebrate Buthelezi’s life as the founder and long-time leader of the IFP, who turns 90 on August 27. The committee said the celebrations would kick off with a thanksgiving service at the Durban Exhibition Centre on August 19, an Umgidi (celebration party) at the Ulundi Regional Sports Complex on August 27, ending with an invitation-only banquet at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre (ICC) on August 31. Addressing the media in Durban yesterday, Prince Zuzile Buthelezi, who is chairperson of the Buthelezi legacy celebration committee and Buthelezi’s son, said his father’s milestone of reaching 90 years of age was worth celebrating and to thank God for his long life and all that he had accomplished. He said they felt obliged to tell Buthelezi of their plans, because had they not he might have “pulled the carpet from under our feet when we were more than halfway, if we did not warn him of our plans”. His son said they had planned the events well in advance, because they would be inviting people from all over the country, the continent and several parts of the world with whom Buthelezi has enjoyed long-lasting friendships. “Everyone who works with him, his colleagues know he still puts in a full day at the office well into the evening, sleeps beyond midnight and wakes up in the morning, which is God’s blessing. “When you turn 90, it’s time to stop and reflect and look back, and we just thought that in all those years as a family, we have never stood up and thanked him because the first thing for us is his role as a family man and as a husband to our mother,” said Buthelezi. He added that they were also honouring their father on behalf of their five late siblings and Buthelezi’s mother Princess Magogo KaDinuzulu, who “had a big influence on his life”. Buthelezi’s daughter Princess Angela Buthelezi said the biggest lessons she had learnt from her father were humility, to be God-fearing and independent, “especially as females”. Daily News
