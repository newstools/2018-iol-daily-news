Durban- A robber, who used a plastic packet to conceal his identity, stabbed a Westville man in the head shortly after he withdrew money from an ATM in Buckingham Terrace on Monday. According to a report from MOBI-CLAW911, a crime prevention and reporting mobile application, an activation alert was received from Woodcutters Restaurant management reporting that an FNB client had withdrawn money from an ATM. When he left the bank he was held up by two men, one wearing a grocery plastic packet on his head. They robbed the victim and then stabbed him in the head with an unknown object. Mike Myers, Mobiclaw representative, said the victim managed to identify them as vagrants. "Whether he will be able to identify them is another story as the one closest to him wore a Checkers packet over his head to cover his face.  What’s more is we work in the industry every day and know for a fact that which beggars have previously been arrested for crimes in the area including a robbery, assault and housebreaking," Myers said. The Westville info group on Facebook took a swipe at vagrants and beggars in the area. Myers said concerned members of the community have, for years, been asking the public to stop supporting the vagrants at the traffic lights in Westville. "By supporting them you are bringing crime into our area and you could be the next victim," he said. ‎The Westville info group said people should consider their service suppliers carefully at night time especially away from secure shopping centres. Westville police are investigating the incident. Daily News
