Thousands of people will be able to see the total eclipse when the full moon slips into the Earth’s shadow. The full moon will begin to darken as it enters the Earth’s shadow at 7.15pm, with the total eclipse beginning at 9.30pm. It is expected to last for at least two hours. The lunar eclipse can be seen from anywhere on the night side of Earth. The extraordinary phenomenon will only occur again in 2029. The eclipse is also known as the blood or red moon because when eclipsed, the moon looks red. Dr Kenda Knowles, of the Astrophysics and Cosmology Research Unit at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said all eclipses were special, but tomorrow’s one would be one of the longest, which would make for great viewing. “Since the moon is bright anyway, you’ll be able to see it regardless of light pollution, but to see the planets Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars almost in line with the moon, you’ll want a nice dark spot where light from the city or streets does not pollute the sky too much,” Knowles said. According to the SA Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), the eclipse could be seen with or without a visual aid. “For those new to astronomy, the evening may prove to be a mesmerising introduction to core scientific principles,” said Dr Daniel Cunnama, science engagement astronomer at the SAAO. “For experienced observers, the sight of the eclipse continues to be mesmerising even when witnessed repeatedly. Young visitors will be entertained and perhaps be inspired to an interest in the wonders of nature and science.” The blue blood moon in January this year was the last time an eclipse occurred.
