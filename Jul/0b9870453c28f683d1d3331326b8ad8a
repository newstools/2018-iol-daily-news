Durban - The South African Post Office will be issuing out a new Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi stamp which pays tribute to diplomatic ties between South Africa and India. The stamp will be launched on Thursday during the Brics Summit in Sandton, Johannesburg. Stamp albums with the stamps of both countries will be presented to President Cyril Ramaphosa and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. “The stamp features illustrations of Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi. The artwork of the Mandela is by Thea Clemons, and the artwork of Gandhi is by Alan Ainslie. Thea Clemons of the South African Post Office: Philatelic Services designed the miniature sheet. The building in the background of the stamp is the Railway Station in Pietermaritzburg, the capital city of KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa,” said Nobuhle Njapha, of the SA Post Office. “Background to the Miniature sheet 125 years ago in May 1893, while Gandhi was on his way to Pretoria, a white man objected to Gandhi’s presence in a first-class carriage, and he was ordered to move to the van compartment at the end of the train,” Njapha continued. She said Gandhi had a first-class ticket, refused and was thrown off the train at Pietermaritzburg. During that winter night at the station, Gandhi decided to stay in South Africa and fight racial discrimination against Indians. “Out of that struggle emerged his unique version of nonviolent resistance, Satyagraha. Today, a bronze statue of Gandhi stands in Church Street, in the city centre of Pietermaritzburg,” she continued. The stamps are available from major post office branches and can be ordered from sa.stamps@postoffice.co.za Daily News
