Durban - A Phoenix resident was caught in the cross-fire during a daring robbery of a local tuck shop on Saturday. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson, said the 35-year-old complainant was on his business premises in Caneside when three unknown suspects entered the premises. "The suspects threatened him with firearms before robbing him of cash, and two cellphones. While the suspects were fleeing the scene they opened fire wounding a customer who was entering the shop. The injured victim was taken to hospital for medical treatment," Zwane said. Glen Naidoo, director of private security company KZN VIP Unit, said residents in the area are calling for the foreign-owned business to be closed due to an increase in robberies and hijackings in the area. "The patron was shot twice while shielding two children at the local supermarket. He was rushed to hospital by his family. One suspect had a firearm. Approximately four shots were fired and projectiles where found scattered on the road.  The suspects fled in different directions in the Caneside area," Naidoo said. The KZN Vip Security, Sealen Security, Syndicate Security and Saps attended to the scene and despite their efforts, the suspects could not be found. Zwane said charges of attempted murder and robbery were opened at Phoenix police station for investigation. Daily News
