The families were living in rooms in a house built on a property along New Glasgow Road, near the Verulam CBD. The “house” was built with sheets of corrugated iron in a rectangular structure, with the interior separated by boards to create seven rooms. Each room was rented out monthly for R300. Joe Mpontshane, the manager of the property, said he was at work, as were the tenants, when he received a telephone call from neighbours that the rooms were on fire. Neighbours from surrounding properties told the Daily News they rushed to the property and began collecting water in buckets to throw on to the flames. “Some neighbours broke the doors down and began pulling out whatever they could. Another attached a hose pipe from another yard and watered down one part. The fire just ate up everything within 20 minutes. I am trying to assist these tenants with alternative accommodation on the property,” Mpontshane said. Most of the items the neighbours salvaged were strewn in the yard. Security guard Innocentia Phuzi, one of the tenants, had arrived home from work after the fire and  was in tears when she saw that the structure had been reduced to ashes. “I am grateful that some of my stuff was saved,” she said picking through her belongings. Cindy Ndlovu, another tenant, said they were not sure what they had lost. She was also going through the items pulled out from the rooms. Beds, mattresses and cupboards were lying on the grass. Prem Balram, from private security company Reaction Unit South Africa, said his response officers assisted in dousing the flames with buckets of water, hose pipes and fire extinguishers. “The fire spread quickly and destroyed all the rooms. Residents managed to salvage some household items. There were no reported injuries,” Balram said. Geoff Pullan, the ward councillor, said he had notified disaster management of the fire. Daily News
