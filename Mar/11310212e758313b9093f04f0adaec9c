 Durban
– The South African National Blood Service (SANBS) is ready for new blood on
Human Rights Day as they expect an influx of new donors on Wednesday, through
their new campaign, #NewBlood. In
a statement, the SANBS said they hope to collect 4 500 units of blood on the
public holiday. “The
SANBS is especially calling on first-time donors and lapsed donors who know
that their blood type is Group O, to donate,” the statement said. “The
SANBS is hosting blood drives around the country to collect the blood,
including in Vilakazi Street, once home to Nobel Peace Prize laureates,
President Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu,” the statement said. SANBS
said first time donors must produce identification when presenting for a
donation. “During
the course of the day, the SANBS will be filling up a virtual blood donor meter
to keep the public apprised of donation numbers -
