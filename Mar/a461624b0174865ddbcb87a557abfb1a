“They asked me for my co-operation and I told them I could not co-operate in any way. They left after two hours. I don’t know what they were after.” Pauw said the Hawks had a search warrant and the complainant in the matter was Arthur Fraser, the director-general of the State Security Agency, who Pauw implicated in corruption in the book. Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi told Independent Media that the matter was referred to the corruption and organised crime-fighting unit by the State Security Agency. “The search-and-seizure warrant was signed by Malmesbury magistrate J Jantjies earlier today (on Wednesday). This is in connection with the investigation into allegations that Pauw disclosed classified information or material entrusted to him by a former member of the State Security Agency of South Africa without the permission of the director-general and is in contravention of the aforesaid act. The search and seizure relates to the book,” Mulaudzi said. He insisted that the Hawks needed to satisfy themselves that Pauw did not have the confidential information and secret documentation used in the book. Mulaudzi said they were not there to arrest Pauw. Pauw said he was “surprised they’ve only arrived now”. He said a colonel and two captains arrived late on Wednesday afternoon. He had contacted his lawyer: “It will be a long search; it’s a big place.” Since his book was published late last year, Pauw has been investigated by the police and been the target of court applications. In December, the SA Revenue Service (Sars) filed papers in the Western Cape High Court accusing him of transgressing the Tax Administration Act. At the time, Pauw said he was astonished by the notice of motion, but felt it was an admission that the revelations contained in his book were true. Daily News
