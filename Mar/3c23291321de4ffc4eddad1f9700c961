The facility, in John Dory Drive in Newlands East, is said to be short-staffed and neglected by the eThekwini Municipality. Resident Thandiwe Gambushe said services at the clinic were poor and that there was a lack of patient care. “People start queuing outside the clinic as early as 4am. When the gates are finally opened, nurses take their time to attend to patients. "Some people have been mugged while waiting out in the clinic yard. “On Fridays, nurses tell patients that they only deal with emergencies and those who come for medication return home without it. The clinic is not properly run,” Gambushe said. Councillor Shontel de Boer, ward 11 proportional representative councillor and DA member, said R5million was budgeted by the municipality to revamp the clinic. De Boer said the revamp was expected in the 2015/16 financial year and was postponed after funds were channelled to another project. “Residents are unhappy. In the 2016/17 financial year, the budget was re-adjusted. The facility is not in a state to handle sick people, and ventilation is poor." The clinic serves the people of Newlands East, Siyanda, Newlands West, Quarry Heights and KwaMashu. Area councillor Joyce Johnson confirmed that funds for the revamp were redirected to another project. She said the work would be done in the 2018/19 financial year, and that she had signed documents for the work. “I have signed documents from the provincial Health Department, and amounts of R4.5million and R1.5m are featured in the documents. “I’m new as a councillor, so I wouldn’t know why there have been delays in revamping this facility,” Johnson said. Tozi Mthethwa, the city’s spokesperson, requested e-mailed questions on the 
matter. Daily News
