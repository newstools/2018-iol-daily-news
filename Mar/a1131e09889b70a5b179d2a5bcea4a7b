Durban - Residents have been warned about keeping valuables where thieves are be able to "fish" items through the window. Andreas Mathios, Blue Security Community and Media Liaison Officer said thieves managed to "fish" a residents laptop out through the window of her home on Wednesday.

He advised residents to make sure that laptops, tablets, cellphones and handbags are stored away from windows and doors and that windows should be secured at night. “Criminals have also used implements like long pool cleaning nets to fish valuables out of open windows and through security gates, so be sure to always store these household tools out of sight.
