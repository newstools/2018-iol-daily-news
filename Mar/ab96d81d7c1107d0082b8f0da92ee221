Durban - The security guard who rushed triathlete Mhlengi Gwala to hospital after a harrowing attack last week, has joined the masses wishing Gwala a speedy recovery. Officer Themba Gumede, was patrolling along Rick Turner (Francois) Road on Tuesday morning when he saw Gwala at the side of the road, waving a flashlight. Gumede, a guard at Fidelity Security, drove towards Gwala to find out what was going on. According to Francois Bartmann, Fidelity Security regional executive, Gumede said that Gwala was bleeding from both his legs and covered in blood. “He told our officer that he had just been attacked. Officer Gumede immediately transported him to the closest medical facility, Albert Luthuli Hospital where Mr Gwala received medical assistance,” Bartmann said. He said the incident was a “horrific act of criminality which has left us all deeply shocked”. Bartman said he was glad Gumede was in the right place at the right time. “This meant Officer Gumede could use his training. We wish Mr Gwala a full and speedy recovery. It is heartwarming though to see how the public has rallied to his aid to raise funds for his medical treatment. This spirit of ‘ubuntu’ is our secret weapon in the fight against crime, and I thank everyone who has pledged money,” he said. Last week, Gwala’s incident made headlines across the world after three men tried to saw off his legs. He was out on a morning ride when he was accosted by the saw-wielding men. It is alleged that Gwala offered the men his watch, cellphone and other valuables but they declined. Gwala was initially rushed to Albert Luthuli Hospital and later transferred to St Augustine's Hospital where he underwent surgery. Police are still looking for the men. Daily News
