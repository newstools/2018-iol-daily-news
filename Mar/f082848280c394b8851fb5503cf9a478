Durban - The National Council of SPCA's (NSPCA) has issued a warning at the Nkandla homestead of former president Jacob Zuma over welfare concerns of the animals. This comes after the NSPCA received a complaint of animals being abandoned, said Marcelle Meredith, Executive Director of the NSPCA. Meredith said that it was alleged that there were only security personnel at the premises and that no one was taking charge and caring for the animals. She said an NSPCA inspector attended to the complaint but was denied entry by the security personnel on duty at the homestead. The inspector then approached the court and was granted a warrant to enter the property and inspect the animals but was still denied entry due to it being a National Key Point. She said later, the inspector approached the relevant officials and was finally granted entry to inspect the conditions under which the animals were being kept and no animals had been abandoned. There were welfare concerns noted at the time of the inspection and a warning was issued. The warning was subsequently complied with and the NSPCA will continue to monitor the animals at the homestead. “The NSPCA will always follow through and investigate when a complaint is received, it does not matter who the owner of the animals are or where in South Africa the animals are situated – we will continue to be the protectors of the voiceless no matter what challenges are thrown at us,” she explained.
