In August, Debbie Stephen was travelling on the N2 from Pinetown when her car was hit by a car that had spun out of control during a high-speed chase between a gang of fleeing men and the police. The chase ended on the N2, near Queen Nandi Drive in Briardene. Three suspected gang members died in the crash. “If it had not been for my grandchildren’s love and them telling me I was beautiful, I do not know what would have happened to me. My family has really been supportive,” she said on Tuesday. Stephen suffered a fractured pelvis, broken arm, cracked ribs, fractured breastbone and a concussion in the accident. She told the Daily News she could not undergo surgery because her body was unable to tolerate the medical pins and screws that would be inserted. Stephen said she had had back surgery before the crash. “I still cannot walk much and am in pain. I was in a wheelchair for three months,” she said. Stephen, a sales consultant, said she had not had any updates from the police on the investigation. “The last interaction I had with the police was when a colonel came to take my statement. He wanted an affidavit from me,” she said. Stephen said she wanted justice to be done. She said it was unethical for people to be shooting at each other on a freeway. “This was a national highway. It just frustrates me. What if it were a bus full of children involved in this crash? Now they are just sweeping it under the carpet like nothing happened,” she said. Daily News
