Durban - A woman and her 4-month-old grandson were treated for smoke inhalation after a fire broke out at an apartment building in Phoenix on Friday morning. Prem Balram, spokesperson for Reaction Unit SA (Rusa) said they were alerted to a fire alert just before 9am. He said when they arrived, they found the top of the building well alight. “Rusa officers evacuated occupants from two flats which are attached to the burning home due to the flames and smoke spreading through the building,” he said. Balram said firemen arrived at the scene and managed to extinguish the blaze. It is alleged that a 4 year old boy was seen playing with a box of matches in one of the bedrooms when the fire started. Earlier in the morning, Rusa was called out to a crash  at the Palmview and R102 intersection in Phoenix, where two men were injured after their vehicles collided. Balram said two men, aged 36 and 54, were stabilised at the scene before being rushed to hospital for further care. Daily News
