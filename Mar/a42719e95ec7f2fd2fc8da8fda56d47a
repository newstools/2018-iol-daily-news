Durban - Animal lovers are urged to get their pets vaccinated against rabies. This follows a noted increase in rabies cases in KwaZulu-Natal. Khaye Nkwanyana, Director of Media Liaison at the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said cases of rabies have been detected along the coastal belt of the province affecting South Coast, Durban, ILembe District and King Cetshwayo District. “We have two cases reported of children having both the dog and cat bites in some of these areas. Unfortunately and regrettably, these two cases have resulted in the loss of lives,” Nkwanyana said. The department has been on a vaccination drive since October last year which began in Ndwedwe, Durban, and has proceeded to both South and North coast of the province especially in rural areas. “Our state vets are hard at work in this regard. Whilst the department is doing all it can to cover the entire province in its vaccination drive, we are calling for the people of KwaZulu Natal to do take the necessary preventative measures,” he said. He urged residents not to entertain strange animals in particular dogs and cats in their neighbourhood. “They must report strange dogs and cats to our nearest local offices or to SPCA for collection. Children must be monitored and told not to play with these domesticated animals, unless they have been recently vaccinated for rabies. In cases where someone has received a dog or cat bite, no matter how minimal it may look, we urge them to immediately approach clinic or hospital within less than 24 hours for rabies treatment,” he said. Last month, two women were treated had to be vaccinated after they were attacked whilst trying to help a dog in Gillits. A Richards Bay child also died after being bitten by a rabid dog. Daily News
