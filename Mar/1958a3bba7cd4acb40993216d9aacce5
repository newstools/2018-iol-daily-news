Durban- The two Friesian horses that were stolen on Tuesday night from the Shongweni Valley inland of Durban have been found. David Armstrong, the owner of horses a Mare and Gelding, was ecstatic when a farmer in Hammersdale notified him that the horses were grazing nearby. Armstrong`s wife had gone to the farm and positively identified them. They are currently arranging for transport to take them back home. Armstrong is still trying to establish how they got out of his six-acre premises near Stonehaven Castle in Hillcrest.  The horses were known to be used in therapeutic practices for children. The Gelding is known as Vince who is 11 years old and dark brown. The Mare is called Riley who is 13 years old and pitch black in complexion. Davids wife Jane Armstrong has worked with them a lot with adults and children in the field of Equine Assisted Psychotherapy. Hundreds of concerned residents were also elated about the find. A Facebook page called Help Find Vince and Riley was created after they went missing on Tuesday. The Friesian (also Frizian) is a horse breed originating in Friesland, in the Netherlands. Although the conformation of the breed resembles that of a light draught horse, Friesians are graceful and nimble for their size Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, KwaZulu Natal police spokesperson, said a case of stock theft has been opened at the Hillcrest SAPS.
