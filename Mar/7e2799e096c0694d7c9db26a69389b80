Durban - The trend of robbers following people after they had withdrawn large sums of cash from banks continued when a Pinetown man was held up outside his home on Saturday morning. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane,  KwaZulu Natal provincial police spokesperson,  said the victim was allegedly robbed by three armed bandits while entering his yard. Zwane said the victim had withdrawn money from a bank. Police believe he may have been followed by the robbers.  Zwane said the robbers fired a single gun shot but no one was injured. He did not know the amount of money the victim had withdrawn from the bank. A close source and member of the neighbourhood watch said the victim had withdrawn money from the Standard Bank in Pinetown. The victim arrived at his New Germany home and while waiting for the driveway gates to open two men wearing balaclavas and gloves approached him. Both men had guns in their hands. The victim accelerated into the driveway, stopped the car and fled down a flight of stairs to another resident`s home in the complex. The robbers were in pursuit of him and fired a gun shot into the air. It is unclear if the man dropped the cash on the floor while he was fleeing or left the money in the car. It is alleged a Mercedes Benz had driven into the complex and fetched the two robbers. Zwane said Pinetown police are investigating the robbery. Daily News
