Durban - General Khehla John Sithole, National Police Commissioner has called for calm in Eshowe after violent protests erupted in the northern KwaZulu-Natal town on Wednesday night. Hundreds went on rampage after a man was shot dead whilst he was fishing at a dam on the  Gqobhokani farm. It is believed that the deceased, Spamandla Xulu and another man were fishing when they were confronted by a security guard. The men were told to leave and an altercation ensued. Xulu was then fatally shot. The second man escaped uninjured.  Since the shooting of Mr Xulu, the security guard has been arrested on a charge of murder and he is currently in police custody.  Sithole said the man suspected of killing Xulu has been arrested and members of the community should allow the law to take its course. "I have tasked to Provincial Commissioner to also mobilize an investigative task team to investigate the burning of the farm house and farms and bring those responsible to book as such behavior is criminal and unacceptable,” he said. Since the shooting, the community is alleged to have taken to the streets initially burnishing tyres on the R66 road followed by the burning of the farmer's house at the Gqobhokani farm, his sugarcane plantation as well as at least two neighbouring plantations.  Sithole said thus far members of the Public Order Police Unit, Tactical Response Team and members of the local police stations have been mobilised to stabilise and normalise the area. "Destroying property is no solution to any problem but rather it is a crime which is punishable by law. Furthermore, It serves to neither help nor correct any situation,” he said. Daily News
