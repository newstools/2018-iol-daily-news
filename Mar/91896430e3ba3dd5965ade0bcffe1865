Two people died when two cars - one of them a police vehicle - collided on Tuesday night along the Shepstone Road, near Chelsea Avenue in New Germany in KwaZulu-Natal. Rescue Care Operations Director Garrith Jamieson said when paramedics arrived on the scene they found carnage. "A police vehicle and a car had collided before the police vehicle overturned coming to rest on its side," explained Jamieson. The crash occurred around 9 pm. "A male and a female were found to be severely entrapped in the wreckage. They had sustained major injuries and when assessed by paramedics ... it was found that they had passed away due to the severity of their injuries." Jamieson said a policeman and two other occupants from the vehicle sustained moderate injuries. They were treated on the scene before they were taken to a nearby hospital. Members of the SA Police Service are investigating the cause of the fatal crash. - African News Agency (ANA); Editing by Moses Mudzwiti
