 nikki shange and her brand of Christianity are literally dangerous. her believing certain things doesn’t make her better at following God, it often means she just misunderstood His word. and that’s that on that, stop bringing her onto my TL. be blessed — foyinsola ✨ MARCH MADNESS 🎊 (@foyinog) March 14, 2018  Twitter trying to bully Nikki Shange for saying what the bible says. Let the Children of the most high rise from the dust!!! Come out from among them — Angel Nomvalo (@angelnomvalo) March 14, 2018  This morning I randomly included Nikki Shange in my prayers I didnt know why, but seeing her trend God was just alerting me to include her in prayers for she will need strength today. Blessings to that lady ❤️ she’s standing for God & all attacks coming to her will not prosper. — Innocent (@Innomatijane) March 14, 2018  😩 Lord deliver us from Nikki Shange — Mom.
