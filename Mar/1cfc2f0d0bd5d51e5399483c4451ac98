And as the founder of 4 Paws and a Tale Rescue operating in the Scottburgh, South Coast area, she also feeds hungry, roaming animals and finds them homes if their owners cannot be traced. She is at present looking after 200 dogs and 35 cats. She also arranges to get them sterilised, to control the population, and treated if they have been injured. She has been vaccinating them for a range of diseases, including rabies, which can prove fatal to humans if they are bitten or licked by a rabid animal and do not get immediate treatment. However, she is now unable to get the rabies vaccines from local vets because what she has been doing is considered illegal by the state veterinarian. “I was told by a state vet that I needed to have studied for a four-year degree to be able to vaccinate against rabies. I think that’s ridiculous. Unqualified farmers and horse owners do their own vaccinations. What’s the difference to me vaccinating animals against rabies?” She goes into the township and rural areas and believes she is well placed to carry out a vaccination service. Asked to comment on the issue, Khaye Nkwanyana, the spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said: “It is true that, in terms of the SA Veterinary Council, anyone not qualified as a vet, or certified at the basic level to administer vaccinations, is not allowed (to vaccinate).” “However, because we need as many people as we can to help us, because we have limited staff resources, we offer basic training to administer animal vaccinations and to get certified to do so under state vet supervision. “This is the route we need to explore for Nicky Koekemoer’s NGO,” he said. Koekemoer responded on Thursday: “Tell me where to go and I will be there like a shot.” Daily News
