IFP spokesperson Joshua Mazibuko said it was not in the interest of the party to delay the conference beyond May. “We need to concentrate on next year’s national elections.” He revealed that the party had discovered hundreds of bogus branches, which was why it had indefinitely postponed its national conference to elect a replacement for its leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The party needed to correct branches that were in disarray because of power mongering among leaders, he said. “For instance, there are about three districts where there are up to 100 branches that are bogus. “You can imagine if we are talking about a district that has about 150 or 200 branches, if 100 of those are bogus, then you have a problem. I don’t have details, but a significant number of branches are bogus.” Preferred Buthelezi had late last year pronounced the party’s KwaZulu-Natal secretary Velenkosini Hlabisa as his ­preferred replacement. Mazibuko said Hlabisa was the preference of the IFP national council, which took a resolution based on the party constitution, which says “the national council has the right to come with its own candidate”. “So two extended national council meetings endorsed comrade Hlabisa as the candidate that we are going to push to the national conference. Up until now there has been no one else who said ‘I want to stand’.” Mazibuko said the party was engaged in auditing branches. “Some of our leaders just go to their neighbours and register people’s names in the IFP membership books without a branch meeting to elect their officials. “We found all those things  which are hindering our progress towards the conference.” He said the party had not yet set a date for the conference, “because the whole process is still stuck in the matter of ensuring that we have credible branches that will go to the conference”.
