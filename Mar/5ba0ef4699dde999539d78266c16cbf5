Protesters blocked access to the township on Wednesday, complaining about a lack of action from police. The criminals are called supermen because they climb up their victims’ houses and break through the roofs using bricks. This has led to the community creating a forum which has allegedly taken the law into its own hands. The Daily News interviewed protesters who said a number of alleged criminals had been killed since December. The Daily News was able to confirm with police that two people had been killed since the weekend. A protester who did not want to be named because she feared reprisals from criminals said they were tired of reporting incidents to the police. “When you report a case at the police station they promise to do something but nothing ever happens My neighbour was raped and she reported the matter to the police. But nothing ever happened and she ended up having to leave the area,” the woman said. The woman said in December “supermen” entered her home while they were having a stokvel party. “They entered through the roof and took our stokvel money,” she said. What angered her was that the thieves were people known to residents. “You see these people walking around as if nothing happened,” she said. Other protesters said they supported the forum as they were tired of crime in the area and had developed a deep mistrust of the police. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the two deaths. He said no arrests had been made. “We criticise vigilantism,” Zwane said. He said police only carried out arrests when there was enough evidence to arrest the accused. Zwane encouraged people to continue to report all incidents of crime. Daily News
