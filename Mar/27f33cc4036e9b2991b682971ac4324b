on Tuesday, on the eve of Kathrada’s one-year death anniversary. The video focuses on 
Kathrada’s political history, on his efforts to fight the apartheid regime, his imprisonment, the Treason Trial and his close relations with Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and other freedom fighters. It also includes short clips 
of Kathrada’s friends, colleagues and his wife, Barbara Hogan, on their experiences with him. It features comments from Mac Maharaj, Ismail Meer, 
Fatima Meer, Sisulu and Mandela. The video depicts the impact he had on the lives of his fellow prisoners and those involved in the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, which he founded in 2008. The Rivonia trialist
