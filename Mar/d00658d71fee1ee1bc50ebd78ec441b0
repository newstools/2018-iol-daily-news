Durban - Fifteen people were arrested at the Howick Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) during a crackdown on corruption related to the fraudulent issuing of motor vehicle driving licences. Simon Zwane, RTMC spokesperson said another official was not found and law enforcement officials have issued a warrant for his immediate arrest. “The suspects including four driver licence examiners, a clerk, a cleaner and nine learner licence applicants were nabbed in a joint police action by the Road Traffic Management Corporation’s National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit, the Hawks and KwaZulu-Natal Traffic and Transport Inspectorate Unit,” Zwane said. He said the arrests were a result of a year-long investigation in which officials from the Howick driver and learner testing centre were observed engaging in unethical and corrupt conduct at the centre. He said the arrested people were expected to appear at the Durban Commercial Crimes Court on Thursday. He said investigations were continuing and more arrests were expected. “Corruption related to the issuing of driving licence documents is a major concern and is believed to contribute significantly to road accidents in South Africa. About 80% of fatal crashes are attributed to human error and the ability of the drivers to handle the vehicle plays an important role in this,” he said. Daily News
