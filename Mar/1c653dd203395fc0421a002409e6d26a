Durban - The bail hearing for the seven men arrested in connection to a string of murders in the violence plagued Glebelands Hostel, south of Durban began in the Durban Regional Court on Monday. In the dock are Bhekukwazi Louis Mdweshu (a police Detective Sergeant) ,27‚ Ncomecile Matlala Ntshangase‚ 34‚ Khayelihle Mbuthuma‚ 32‚ Eugene Wonderboy Hlope‚ 45‚ Mbuyiselwa Mahliphiza Mkhize‚ 28‚ Vukani Mcobothi‚ 25‚ and Mondli Talente Mthethwa‚ 28. They were arrested in a series of raid in December last year and have allegedly been linked to several murders in the hostel. Since 2014, about 106 people have been killed in the ongoing conflict at the hostel. In a statement, read by Advocate Jimmy Howse who is representing Mdweshu, he said his client was not a flight risk and that the charges against him which include murder and attempted murder were part of a broad sweeping charges against many people. He said he found it strange that he was arrested in 2017 for incidents that allegedly happened between 2014 and 2016. Mdweshu said he seriously doubted the prosecution had substantial evidence against him and believed that he would be acquitted. "There are no direct eyewitnesses that implicate me in most of these charges," Mdweshu said. Mdweshu said he had lived at the hostel between 1999 and 2015, but left after there was an attempt on his life. He said he had two children to support. Mdweshu said he was currently suspended from the police force without pay and believed that if he was granted bail he would be reinstated and receive a salary again. He also noted that he had a previous charge of murder in 1996 but this was withdrawn he said. Mdweshu was one of seven accused in the court room. The bail application is continuing. Daily News
