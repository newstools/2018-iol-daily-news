Durban - While a KwaZulu-Natal couple is relieved that the body of a child they had to identify was not their daughter, their hearts ache for the family who now has to bury their little girl. However, the search continues for Siphesihle Dlamin, 3, who went missing in December, last year. Mxolisi Ngwane, was speaking to the Daily News just hours after he and Thabsile Dlamini, had to identify the body of a girl at a mortuary in Witbank. At the time of her disappearance, Siphesihle had attended a church service in Amandawe on the KZN South Coast on New Year's Eve. As the service was about to end, Dlamini was called up to the front of the hall to speak to congregants. It was their first time at the church. Dlamini left Siphesihle sitting on the chair, holding her bag. When she returned, the toddler was nowhere to be seen. Dlamini said they searched outside and neighbouring homes but could not find her daughter. Ngwane said they were sad for the family who the girl at the morgue, belonged to. “We know how they feel. If we had to get news that Siphesihle was dead, my heart would be broken,” he said. Ngwane said Dlamini was not coping very well with the recent events. “She is nervous. Having seen the body at the mortuary, she is panicking now. Even though we know this girl is not our daughter, our hearts are very sore,” he said. Daily News
