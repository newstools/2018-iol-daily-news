Durban - The community is warned to remain vigilant while listening to music via their earphones when commuting to or from work. The warning comes after a security guard was killed when he was run over along Ndwedwe Road in Cottonlands, north of Durban on Tuesday morning. The 25-year old man was on his way to work when he was knocked. Prem Balram of Reaction Unit SA, said when they arrived at the scene, they found that the man had suffered life threatening injuries. “The deceased was a security officer based at the King Shaka International Airport. According to witnesses he had his earphones on while crossing the road,” Balram said. He said the car that knocked the man was extensively damaged. “The vehicle managed to come to a stop approximately 100 metres away from the point of impact. The driver was not injured,” he said. Police are investigating further. In a separate incident last month, a man living in oThongathi, north of Durban, was killed by a train in Verulam while he was on his way to work. Balram said upon arrival, the body of the deceased was found ripped into two pieces. "Human remains were strewn along the railway line approximately 100 metres away from the point of impact,” said Balram. He said it was confirmed that the man was on his way to work and was run over by a train while taking a shortcut. It is alleged that he had his earphones on and was listening to music and therefore did not hear the train approaching. Daily News
