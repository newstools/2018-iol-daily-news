Buti Manamela, Deputy Minister of Higher Education and Training (DHET), this week met members of the DUT Council Executive Committee and unions to find a way forward after wage negotiations deadlocked last month. Professor Thandwa Mthembu, DUT vice chancellor and principal, said a framework for the mediation process on the salary impasse was agreed upon. He confirmed the lockout was suspended and negotiations have resumed. “Normal operations will, thus, commence and all departments at DUT will start functioning on Thursday, March 1. All lectures will resume on Monday, March 5. The individual faculties will liaise with students regarding the new academic calendar for the first semester,” he said. Mthembu urged staff to work together to salvage what was left of the first semester. “Having lost almost four weeks of academic work, our unwavering focus should be on how best we could make amends for this. We owe this to ourselves, the community at large and to our country,” he said. During the meeting with Manamela, unions and DUT Exco agreed to: *  Revert to the mediation process under the auspices of the CCMA; *  The three variables - across the board increase (6.5% - 8.5%), housing allowance; (R200 - R400) and the one-off bonus (R7 500)  - will be the focus of the mediation process; *  The implementation of the no-work-no-pay principle will form part of the negotiations; *  The suspension of the strike with the academic programme resuming on March 1; *  The mediation process to conclude within three days, from February 28; and *  The deputy minister, Exco chairperson and Nehawu and Fedusa general secretaries to monitor the mediation process.
