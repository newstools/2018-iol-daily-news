Durban - Many South Africans rely on polony and ready to eat meats for sandwiches, lunch and hot dogs. However, they somehow found humour in no longer eating these foods - for the time being at least -  after a mass recall of the product by Tiger Brands following a listeriosis outbreak. Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi revealed that the source of listeriosis, the food-borne disease, which has killed more than 150 people, is found in polony and other processed and ready to eat meats such as viennas and cold meats. Motsoaledi was speaking at a press briefing at the offices of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg on Sunday. He said the source of the present listeriosis outbreak is the Enterprise factory in Polokwane. Products from RCL foods and Enterprise would be recalled in South Africa and abroad. Most cases of the disease were reported in Gauteng, the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Listeriosis is caused by a bacteria found in soil, water, vegetation and animal faeces, and can contaminate food, such as fresh meat, dairy and seafood. However, it is can be prevented by basic hygiene and washing food. All you need to know about Listeriosis.
