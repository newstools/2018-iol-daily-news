Durban - Residents in the city have been well informed about the issue of burial space. This is according to Sli Ndlovu,Â Parks and Cemeteries manager at the eThekwini Municipality. She was speaking at the hearings into the access to burial sites hosted by the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL Rights Commission) on Thursday. The purpose of the hearing was to investigate complaints related to the disrespect of the departed and the denial of the right to access ancestral graves. Some of the complaints that the CRL Rights Commission deals with include the rights of some communities that have been compromised. Ndlovu said the issue space for burials is not new. Despite a large influx of people to the city from rural areas and outside provinces in search of work, the city has maintained its burial space. There has been a move by the municipality to sway the community to consider cremation. This, according to Ndlovu, is due to burials not being a technically sustainable matter. She said the city has identified three pieces of land to assist in burials for the next 50 years at least. "We are also looking into constructing two sites for cremations. We are in talks with legal and the health department to creating five memorial walls with CAS numbers for burials of paupers so their families are able to identify their loved ones later on," she said.
