Durban - Police arrested a gang of house robbers following an operation in Brighton Beach earlier this week. Members of the Provincial Vehicle Task Team, Durban K9 Unit, Durban Metro K9 Unit and other units spotted a suspicious blue Opel Astra with four occupants, said Colonel Thembeka Mbhele. “The vehicle had no front registration plates. Initially when the members tried to stop the vehicle, it sped off. The team managed to intercept the vehicle whilst attempting to flee. One of the suspects was tackled by a canine. Upon searching the vehicle, two firearms were recovered. It was established that one of the firearms was taken during a house robbery in February in the Amanzimtoti area,” Mbhele said. She said the men were also linked to a house robbery and attempted murder committed on Monday night in Athlone Park, where two armed men entered the house and robbed the homeowner and shot him. The cellphone was recovered from the men. She said the preliminary investigation was conducted at the scene and it revealed that the recovered vehicle was taken during a house robbery at Sydenham on Valentine’s Day. “One of the suspects is out on bail for a house robbery case committed in Scottburgh on January 8. He was due to appear in court on March 20. The arrested suspects will be profiled to see if they are linked to other robberies committed in the Amanzimtoti and surrounding areas. The suspects are aged between 19 and 31 will appear in the Durban Magistrates’ Court on charges of possession of a stolen property, possession of unlicensed firearms, ammunition and house robbery,” she said. Major General Bheki Langa, KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, praised the teams for arresting the men responsible for terrorising the community. Daily News
