Durban - Five students from the Varsity College Durban North campus have been selected in the UNISA top 20 Certificate in Theory of Accounting (CTA) programme. The CTA is accredited by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA) which grants accreditation of programmes that lead to the qualification of Chartered Accountants in South Africa. The five students selected are Evan Anderson, Tilicia Moodley, Wade Simkiss, Ilke Stolz and Botepo Mohale. Botepo Mohale said the journey leading up to this achievement was not easy. “I cannot remember the number of times I slept late and studied while watching Eric Thomas's videos to stay motivated and hungry to thrive," Mohale said. Mohale added that she would sometimes call her mother in tears begging for motivation. Commenting on the achievement, Tilicia Moodley said, the journey was extremely rocky. "The dedication and sacrifice required is immense but if you truly have a goal in mind and know where you want to be, even the unimaginable becomes possible," Moodley said. The students expressed that even though it was not easy getting this achievement is very rewarding. “Being in the top 20 for me has proved that hard work, determination, positive mindset and of course support from my friends and family goes a long way, not forgetting consistency as this is extremely needed for CTA,” Mohale said. Margi Boosey the principal at VC Durban North campus said she was proud of our CTA students and their exceptional performance. "To have five students from the same campus in the national top 20 is a remarkable achievement," she added. Daily News
