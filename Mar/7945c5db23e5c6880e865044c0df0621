Durban - Lectures are set to begin at the Durban University of Technology (DUT) on Monday after an agreement was reached regarding the salary impasse which saw staff members protest since January. Angry students protested last week as they had not been to a single lecture since the academic year began. The agreement between staff and management will see lectures start on Monday. This week, Buti Manamela, Deputy Minister of Higher Education and Training (DHET), met with members of the DUT Council Executive Committee and unions to find a way forward after wage negotiations deadlocked last month. Professor Thandwa Mthembu, DUT Vice-Chancellor and Principal, said a framework for the mediation process regarding the salary impasse was agreed upon. He confirmed that the lockout was suspended and negotiations have resumed. “Normal operations will, thus, commence and all departments at DUT will start functioning on Thursday, 1 March. All lectures will resume on Monday, 5 March. The individual faculties will liaise with students regarding the new academic calendar for the first semester,” he said. Mthembu urged staff to work together to salvage what was left of the first semester. “Having lost almost four weeks of academic work, our unwavering focus should be on how best we could make amends for this. We owe this to ourselves, the community at large and to our country,” he said. During the meeting with Manamela, unions and DUT EXCO agreed to:   Daily News
