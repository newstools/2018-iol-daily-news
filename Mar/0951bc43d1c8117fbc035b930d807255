Durban - The search for a missing man is set to resume on Monday after he was presumed to have drowned near the Margate Pier in Shelly Beach on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast at the weekend. Craig Lambinon, National Sea Rescue Institute spokesperson, said in the early hours of Sunday morning, the NSRI Shelly Beach duty crew, SAPS Search and Rescue and an ambulance were dispatched to the area. “The man is aged 34 and is from the Eastern Cape,” Lambinon said. He said an extensive search revealed no sign of the missing man and police are continuing an ongoing search operation and an investigation has been launched. Lambinon said later in the day, the crew was dispatched to assist a charter boat that had suffered motor mechanical failure, offshore at Shelly Beach. “The sea rescue craft Shelly Spirit was launched and ferried eight crew to shore from the casualty craft. The sea rescue craft Spirit of Dawn was prepared to be launched to assist but after all eight crew from the casualty craft were safely brought ashore the casualty vessel was able to beach on one motor unassisted and once safely ashore no further assistance was required,” he said.
