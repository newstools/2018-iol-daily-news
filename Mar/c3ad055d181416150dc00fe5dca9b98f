The group of 30 worshippers were in the middle of a prayer inside the Noor-Ul-Islam Society mosque on Greenbury Drive when they heard frantic screams for help. Yusuf Dawood, who manages the mosque, said two men had walked up to his house and demanded that his wife, Sauda, unlock the burglar gate. The couple live behind the mosque. “My wife was holding our 9-month-old boy in her arms, trying to make him sleep when she heard the knock on the door. This is a place of prayer and nobody would expect robbers to attempt anything here. When she came into the passage, one of them pointed a gun at her and threatened to shoot if she did not open,” Dawood said. He said the men then pushed her aside and when she tried to make a dash for it, a third man appeared, told her to be quiet, grabbed her by the arm and pushed her back into the house. Dawood said his wife mustered up the courage to push one of the robbers aside and run out of the house and into the mosque. The robbers then fled. “They took R700 which was set aside for groceries, and three cellphones. I heard they had parked their car nearby, but I did not see it. Police have the car’s registration number from a witness. The robbers had used a false set of plates,” he said. Dawood has been living on the property for 17years and this was the first robbery he had experienced. He said they would hire a security guard for the premises. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of robbery was opened at Phoenix police station. No arrests have been made. Daily News
