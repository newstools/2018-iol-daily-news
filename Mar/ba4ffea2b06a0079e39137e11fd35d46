Durban - The family of slain Wentworth woman Bianca Parsons clapped this morning when it was revealed that one of the men accused of killing her last month wants to plead guilty to the crime. Darryl Murrisson, 33, and Christopher Houston, 26, made their second appearance in connection with Parsons's murder in the Durban Magistrate's Court today. Parsons's friends and family filled out the court. Murrison revealed that he wants to plead guilty, while Houston is due to apply for bail next week. The men allegedly shot Parsons while she was seated in her parked car at a petrol station in Tara Road on February 24. Her 3-year-old daughter was in the car at the time, while her husband had gone into a convenience store. Murrison and Houston were arrested shortly after the murder. The men are due back in court on March 14. Parsons was shot in an apparent case of mistaken identity. Daily News
