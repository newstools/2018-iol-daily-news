Durban - While the search continues for a British couple, one of the people accused of their abduction, was denied bail in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Themba Xulu, 19, made an appearance in court where Magistrate Valaramen Kathravaloo passed the decision to deny Xulu bail. Xulu, along with Bibi Fathima Patel, 26, and Sayefundee Aslam Del Vecchio, 38 was arrested in connection with the disappearance of British couple, Rod and Rachel Saunders, world famous horticulturists. It is alleged that Patel and Del Vecchio have links to ISIS. It is alleged that the trio abducted the couple to get their hands on R734 000. The Saunders credit cards were allegedly used to purchase jewellery, electronics and camping gear in the uMhlanga area. It is alleged that the transactions took place between February 10 and 15 - around the time the couple went missing. The Saunders’s vehicle, a white Toyota Land Cruiser which was stolen during the alleged kidnapping, was recovered by police in the Eshowe area days later. There was blood on the back seats. Del Vecchino and Patel are both charged with kidnapping, robbery, theft, contravening the  protection of constitutional democracy against terrorist and related terrorist activities. Xulu faces charges of theft, kidnapping and robbery with aggravating circumstances. Xulu, along with Patel and Del Vecchio are due back in court next month. Daily News
