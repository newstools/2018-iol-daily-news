Durban - Five people in two separate incidents were shot dead at Ekombe in northern KZN on Wednesday night. Major General Bheki Langa, KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner condemned the attacks which took place 30 minutes apart. “I have instructed that a task team investigate the murders. We are also appealing to community members to come forward with information that will lead to the arrest of the suspects,” said Langa. Captain Nqobile Gwala, police spokesperson said the first incident took place at 9.30pm at Mphalwini in Ekombe where two unknown gunmen entered the house and opened fire at a family who were seated inside a rondavel. “Four victims aged between 18 and 76 sustained gunshot wounds to the upper body and died on the scene. One of the victims is a traditional healer and the other is a traditional healer trainee who also died during the attack. One victim believed to be in his thirties sustained gunshot wounds and was taken to hospital for medical attention. Two children aged 13 and 16 managed to escape unharmed and sought help from the neighbours,” said Gwala. She said the other incident took place at Ezimbidla, also in Ekombe at 10pm where neighbours heard gunshots. When they checked in the morning, they found that the neighbour’s house windows were damaged. “They went to investigate but there was no one inside the house. A few metres away from the house, the body of a 70-year-old man was found in the bushes. He sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the upper body. The deceased is also a traditional healer in the area and was living alone at the house. The motive for the attack is unknown at the stage. The investigation will determine whether the two incidents are linked or not,” she said. Daily News
