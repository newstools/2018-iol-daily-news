Durban - President Cyril Ramaphosa urged the youth to register to vote this weekend for the elections next year. Voting stations will be open for all new voters to register and those looking to update their addresses are also urged to do so. Here is what the youth had to say about voting: Fanelwa Sithole, 21, from Matatiele, said: “I am going to register early on Saturday. I am going to vote because I am a member of the ANC Youth League and must lead by example.” Mbali Gumede, 20, from Esikhawini, said: “I am still waiting to find out which station I can register at and then I will because we’re voting for a new president.” Zithulele Ndlela, 22, from Berea, said: “I am a registered voter and I choose to vote because voting gives you a right of having a say in what happens in your own country.” Scelo Mndebele, 24, from the Durban CBD, said: “I am a registered voter and I choose to vote because we elect someone that is going to represent our views in the country.” Siyabonga Ngcamu, 21, from Maphumulo, said: “I am planning to register here in Durban because I believe that voting is the only way you can express your voice in South Africa.” Leoni Uwase, 22, from the Durban CBD, said: “I am planning to register. Why wouldn’t I want to have a voice and to speak my mind? People must vote because you can’t complain if you don’t have a voice.” Sinazo Mangqalaza, 20, from the Eastern Cape, said: “I am a registered voter. I vote because with my vote I can bring about change. I can give other people the chance to get free education and get people out of poverty.” Prince Mokoteli, 19, from the Eastern Cape, said: “They always say every vote makes a difference but I don’t think mine will make a difference because at the end of the day majority rules. They don’t need my vote.” Nqobile Malikiti, 18, from Mthatha, said: "I am not a registered voter but I will register this weekend. I believe my vote will make a difference. I believe in change."
