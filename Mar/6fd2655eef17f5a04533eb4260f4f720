Durban - Delron Buckley, former Bafana Bafana winger has danced his way out of Dancing With The Stars SA on Sunday after his second consecutive Dance-Off in the bottom two pairs. Judges Bryan Watson, Debbie Turner, Tebogo Kgobokoe, and Jason Gilkison voted to keep netball star Vanes-Mari du Toit in the competition for another week. A statement issued by Mnet said the theme was Movie Week, as celebrity dancers and their partners moved to the music of some of the world’s most popular silver screen hits. “From Fame to Beauty and the Beast, the contestants pulled out all of the stops to make it a night to remember. Hoping that the force would be with him tonight, Delron performed the notorious Paso Doble to the iconic Star Wars theme music, but in the end his efforts didn’t translate,” the statement said. “I think there was too much in your head,” Tebogo Kgobokoe said of his performance. The statement said Buckley had started very low on the leaderboard, with award-winning judge Jason Gilkison wanting to Red Card him for his messy footwork in Week 1, but the judges were impressed with his dedication and dramatic improvements week-on-week. Judge Jason raved that Delron’s energetic Charleston in Week 5 was his “breakthrough dance”. By last week’s Jive routine, judge Debbie Turner thought that Delron was “turning into a tiger”, but unfortunately this week’s Paso Doble proved a dance step too far. Buckley said his experience on Dancing With The Stars SA opened his eyes to the world of dance, “and I take my hat off to you guys,” he told the judges. He also paid tribute to his wife Raphaela, who flew in from Durban every weekend to support him in this adventure. Daily News
