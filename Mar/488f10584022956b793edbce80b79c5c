Durban - Former Minister of Police, Fikile Mbalula, was known for his quick wit on Twitter. Whether he was defending his family trips abroad or getting into Twitter wars or ‘twars’ as they are called, Mbalula’s Twitter activity often made headlines.
Fast forward a president’s resignation and a cabinet reshuffle and the new (well not so new) Police Minister has snubbed Twitter altogether. General Bheki Cele has sent a stern warning to those impersonating him via fake accounts on Twitter. “He does not have any Twitter handle and he does not want a Twitter handle,” Cele’s spokesperson, Nonkululeko Phokane said. Phokane said Cele has expressed his disappointment and utter disgust at some of the Twitter posts from the fake accounts. “He wishes to state categorically clear that any Twitter account or any social media account operating in his name is fake and that no one is authorised to operate any social media account in his name. All official communication on matters of the office of the Minister of Police will be communicated accordingly by his office,” Phokane said. Cele said the mushrooming Twitter handles in his name were “sinister” and were “aimed at dragging his name through dirty and tricky mud games”. “Social media remains a respectable communication platform that should be exempted from any abuse by ghost operators,” Phokane said. He has further observed all social media comments from genuine individuals since his appointment. “I positively welcome and receive all of them as building blocks towards a concerted effort in creating a safe South Africa for all,” Cele said. Meanwhile, Mbalula's Twitterverse is far from losing its sparkle. He was appointed as the Head of Elections at the African National Congress Headquarters. From 'Minister Fear Fokol' to ANC Elections Chair, @MbalulaFikile remains far from done with the social media shine. I mean he would not want to leave his more than one million followers disappointed. Daily News
