Durban - A man was rescued after having been trapped inside a grain silo for several hours in the KwaZulu-Natal town of Winterton, on Sunday. Russel Meiring, spokesperson for ER24, said the man was found, lying chest-deep inside a grain silo. "Several men had climbed inside the silo and began to remove the large amount of grain.Â Provincial Services utilised various rescue and cutting equipment to cut a large hole in the bottom of the silo, allowing more access for grain to be removed. After several hours, the man was finally freed from the silo," Meiring said. He said the man was treated for his injuries and provided with pain-relief medication before he was airlifted by a private medical helicopter to Mediclinic Pietermaritzburg Hospital for further care. Meanwhile, on Saturday, 25 people were seriously injured when a bakkie crashed along Main Road in Hammarsdale. All the patients, men between the ages of 18 and 40, were treated and transported to nearby hospitals for further medical care. Daily News
