Michaela Crankshaw, 12; Jemma Kasavan, 12; Jaskaran Rajaruthnam, 12; and Sam Walker, 13 - all Manor Gardens Primary School Grade7 pupils - took first position in the national championships held at St David’s in Johannesburg last month. School principal Carol Lottering said it was a wonderful result for the school. “We are all very proud of our Kids' Lit Quiz champions who were up against a number of bigger and more affluent schools. "We are extremely grateful for the effort by Isobel Sobey, the media centre teacher who co-ordinates and coaches the teams, and other teachers at this school who work tirelessly at constantly raising the bar in education, and their incredible ability to instil a love for reading,” Lottering said. Sobey said the Kids' Lit Quiz was the brainchild of Wayne Mills, a university lecturer of New Zealand, who came up with the concept 27 years ago. “He calls it ‘The Sport of Reading’. He developed the quiz to promote reading for pleasure and to reward good readers in the same way that sports stars are rewarded by their schools and communities. "The first quiz took place in 1991 with 14teams. It has grown into a hugely popular annual event spanning five continents with almost 20000 children participating in heats throughout the year,” she said. Tough Sobey said the team would be up against tough competition from China, UK, US, Canada, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Hong Kong, Thailand and Indonesia. “The four members in our team are all avid readers. They have worked hard for this since Grade 1 and are deserving winners. They will have a wonderful time in New Zealand and soak up all the lessons and experiences that come their way. "Now we begin the hard work of intense coaching for the international event, as well as fund-raising to help the children reach an amazing goal,” she said. Daily News
