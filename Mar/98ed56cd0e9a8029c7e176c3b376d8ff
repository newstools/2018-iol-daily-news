Durban - A New Germany resident just kept driving after a brick was thrown at his car on Tuesday night. Anthony Gounden, 56, was driving home from Umbilo when he saw what he described as a ‘meteor’ flying towards his car. Gounden said he had decided to ditch the N2 and drive through the back roads which led him through Sherwood, towards Reservoir Hills and to New Germany. “There was a bit of traffic and I was driving on the middle lane when I saw what looked like a meteor flying towards me,” he said. He said the object had hit the bonnet of his BMW cabriolet sport and onto his windscreen. “I just kept driving,” he continued. “I didn’t stop. I couldn’t stop because of the cars behind me. Besides, you don’t stop in that kind of situation.” He said on Wednesday morning when he took a closer look at the damage, he noticed that the object thrown at his car the previous night was a brick because he found chips of it and pieces of glass in his car. Even through a traumatic ordeal, he had time to think of other motorists. “It could have been worse,” he said. “I could have been distracted and all the other cars could have been affected.” He said he had heard and talked about the other rock throwing incidents but he never thought it would happen to him. On Wednesday morning, he went to the police station to report the incident and his car has gone for repairs. Daily News
