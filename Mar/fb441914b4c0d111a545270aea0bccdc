Durban- The Police Search and Rescue Unit continued to search streams and culverts surrounding the Chatsworth stadium for a man who went missing during Sunday's sudden flash storm. Captain Nqobile Gwala, KwaZulu Natal police, said police were informed that a 23-year-old man was allegedly washed away into the stormwater culvert due to heavy rain in the Chatsworth area. Police, who are not releasing any further details about the incident, had not found his body despite an intensive search effort. The Daily News interviewed several eThekwini parks and gardens staff that maintain the grounds around the stadium. They were shocked to hear about the incident. They had only become aware of the incident when they saw several police vehicles arrive in the parking lot. Policemen walked along the culvert peering intensely into the storm culvert. Several driving school instructors who utilised the parking lot told the Daily News that the police were following the path of the stormwater outlets to try and find the body.  This particular stormwater culvert continued under the Higginson Highway and flowed through the Bottlebrush Informal Settlement on its path towards the Umhlatuzana River. Meanwhile, in Dundee, the search also continues for Warrant Officer Arnesh "Jakes" Juggan,56, a Dundee SAPS policeman, his wife Molly,54, and their friend Ashoak Rajoo,53, who were reported missing since Friday night. Police are searching in the area where their last cellphone signals were pinged to. They are presumed to have been washed away while trying to cross a low bridge over the Buffalo River between Dundee and Vryheid. Daily News
