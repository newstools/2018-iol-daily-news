Durban - A fake abortion doctor and his wife were sentenced to five years imprisonment after they pleaded guilty to running an illegal abortion clinic in the Durban Central Business District. The couple Ahmed Katabazi, 48, a Ugandan citizen, and his wife, Buyisiwe Vivian Sosibo, 40, were arrested in December last year, after a sting operation was set up by a joint team comprising Metro Police Crime Prevention, SAPS Crime Intelligence and SAPS Organised Crime. In handing down sentence in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Friday morning, the presiding magistrate said if they display good behaviour, they will be eligible for release after serving a 10th of their jail term (6 months). Katabazi will be deported upon completion of his sentence. KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo has welcomed the sentence, saying that he hopes it will serve as a deterrent to others. Meanwhile, police have vowed to continue clamping down on bogus doctors and traditional healers conducting illegal abortions in the Durban CBD. Daily News
