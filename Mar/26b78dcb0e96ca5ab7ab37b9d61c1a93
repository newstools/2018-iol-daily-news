Durban - The Provincial Drug Task Team recovered a total of R356 900 worth of cocaine in Point and Wentworth in two separate raids on Tuesday. Captain Nqobile Gwala, police spokesperson said the team was following up on information about a man suspected to be dealing in drugs and supplying drug dealers with rock cocaine powder at Point and surrounding areas. After observations and activity monitoring, a takedown operation was conducted at a flat in Point area, where a 40-year-old man was arrested for dealing in drugs. “He was found in possession of 92 full moon of rock cocaine, 41 loops of cocaine powder, 9.8 grams of pure cocaine, 20 grams of yellow rock cocaine powder in a wet form and one and a half kilogram of white powder. The estimated street value of recovered drugs is R350 000,” Gwala said. She said he appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. She said the team then went on to Wentworth while following up on information about drugs activities in the area. “Disruptive drug operations were conducted at one of the flats’ parking lots. The place was searched and 69 bags of cocaine were found between the concrete wall bricks. The street value is more than R6 900. No one was arrested but removing such drugs from the streets means preventing such drugs from reaching the hands of our youth. Follow-up operations will be conducted to ensure that the dealer is apprehended,” she said. Daily News
