And now she has her sights set on winning the prestigious Miss South Africa title, one of the richest pageants in the world. The fourth-year medical 
student who is studying at Stellenbosch University, ­auditioned for Miss SA in Cape Town at the weekend, and 
was selected as a regional qualifier. She now joins the ranks of other KZN qualifiers, Karishma Ramdev, 23, of Chatsworth, a fifth-year medical student at the University of Pretoria; Leah Prinsloo, 22, of Morningside, a graphic designer; Noxolo Ndebele, 24, of Pinetown, who did her BCom Acc degree at the University of Zululand and currently works as a project financial controller; and Avania Reddy, 25, of Westville, a mechanical engineer. They, along with Letsoalo, stand a chance to make it to the Top 12, to be announced on May3 before the pageant on May27. “I am very proud, very excited and still trying to breathe about it all,” said Letsoalo,
who was back working in a paediatric hospital ward yesterday. Winning the Miss Varsity crown at Stellenbosch University last year (and going on to become the First Princess in the national competition) gave her the confidence to enter for the Miss South Africa title. “I want that crown; that’s what I am going to get,” she vowed last night. She said she would become a doctor in two years’ time, and it would be nice to get another title next to her name. It would also be helpful to get some funding for her studies as “I am working on loans”, she said. Miss South Africa 2018 will certainly receive a massive 
financial boost, and in addition to getting the coveted crown and winner’s sash, she will also receive R1million in cash from sponsors Sun International and Cell C. The title will also come with a bouquet of prizes, including a car and products valued at more than R2m - and the new winner will also get the use of a fully furnished and serviced apartment for the year of her reign.
