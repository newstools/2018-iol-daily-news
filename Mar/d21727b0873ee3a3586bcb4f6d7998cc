Durban - The Federation For Radical Economic Transformation (FFRET) and Amadelangokubona held a media briefing in Chesterville on Tuesday morning. Among the issues to be addressed were the resolutions of last week's two-day Radical Economic Transformation conference held here in Durban. FFRET is a federation of business associations around the province. It partnered with the city to drive the economic transformation agenda through empowering and helping small and emerging entrepreneurs to ensure that they are participants on the mainstream economy. Zazi Nxele, the federation's spokesperson said the federation was also concerned about a video depicting Delangokubona's president which was seen as inciting violence. "That will be one of the issues that will be addressed. In fact the federation wants to make its stand clear with regards to violent talk, and it was so much unfortunate that one of the leaders had to make such statements in that video. That issue, however, will be dealt with within the federation. Most importantly, we want to impart the resolutions of the conference and the way forward," Nxele said this morning before the conference. In the video in question, which was shot during the conference, Nyandu pleaded with some municipal officials to stop playing games and take Delangokubona seriously. Delangokubona falls under the federation. "We don't have time to play. We are not scared to get arrested. We didn't hand over all the guns, we still have some of the guns. Phillip Sithole (deputy city manager, economic development and planning), don't mess around with us. You've been promising us money and we want results. We want Ithala to give us money to buy warehouses cause those in Isipingo we don't know who they serve," Nyadu said in the video. The briefing is about to start. Daily News
