The group of about 50 paramedics marched through the Durban central business district as they made their way to the ANC provincial head office on Stalwart Simelane (Stanger) Street to hand over a memorandum to Super Zuma, the former ANC provincial secretary. Sifiso Dlamini, leader of the disgruntled workers, said they were demanding the department pay them an occupation specific dispensation (OSD). An OSD is aimed at keeping workers within government service and also attracting people to work for the public sector through improved remuneration. Dlamini said they went to the ANC’s head offices in the hope the party would call Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo to order. He said this was an issue that had been dragging on for more than nine years. They had won court orders and arbitration hearings but the department apparently still had not paid the money. Dlamini and Zuma got into a heated argument outside the ANC’s offices (See video). Dlamini wanted a response within seven days that their matter was going to be resolved. He said if Zuma did not give them a response within seven days, they would take the matter to the ANC’s national office. Zuma said it was difficult to tell when they would process the protesters’ demands because the ANC was not the employer. One of the marchers, Philani Mvelase, a paramedic for the past 12 years, believed Dhlomo was looking down on workers. The health MEC said he could not comment on the matter as he had not seen the memorandum. He said he had sent an official to receive the document containing the workers’ demands. Daily News
