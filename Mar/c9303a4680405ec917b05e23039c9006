Durban - Police have arrested a gang of hijackers in Ntuzuma while following information on a man wanted for hijackings in the area. According to Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, police spokesperson, on Thursday afternoon, police spotted and tried to stop a vehicle driven by the man but the driver fled the scene on foot towards nearby houses while shooting at police. “The team gave chase and during an exchange of gunfire the suspect was fatally wounded. Two unlicensed firearms were recovered from his possession. The suspect was positively identified as wanted in a hijacking case that was reported at KwaMashu in December last year,” explained Zwane. He said an inquest docket was opened for further investigation and the firearms seized will be sent for ballistic tests to establish if they were used in any other crimes in the province. “The same team arrested four suspects who were also part of the gang operating with the deceased to hijack vehicles in KwaMashu, Phoenix and Ntuzuma areas. These suspects were arrested last week and they were linked to various hijackings in the area. They all appeared in the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court facing various charges,” continued Zwane. “We appeal to motorists to take extra precautions when driving in their vehicles to curb such hijackings. Beware of any suspicious-looking persons or vehicle following your vehicle. Be vigilant when entering or leaving your premises. Avoid parking in isolated areas especially at night or socialising whilst sitting in your car whilst on the road or alongside pavements,” said Zwane. The KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa commended the police for their commitment and dedication in curbing trio crimes in the province. “We remain committed to eradicating crime and no wanted suspect will remain on the run forever,” he said.
