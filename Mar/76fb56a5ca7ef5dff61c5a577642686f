Durban - A 15-year-old teenage girl drowned at St Michael’s Beach, along the south coast of Durban on Saturday afternoon. Craig Lambinon, Sea Rescue spokesperson said National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Shelly Beach rescue swimmers responded to the scene of the incident to help police search and rescue and MedEvac ambulance services following reports of a drowning. “On arrival on the scene a female teenager, age 15, was found to already be out of the water and CPR efforts commenced. Sadly after all CPR efforts were exhausted the teenager was declared deceased by paramedics,” said Lambinon. He said the body of the local teenager was handed to Forensic Pathology Services and police have opened an inquest docket. On Friday the same crew was activated following reports of a diver injured on a dive charter boat. “Prior to NSRI launching our sea rescue craft the dive boat had reached Shelly Beach with dive charter crew providing First Aid to an injured diver with a laceration to his head believed to have been caused by a bump on the boat,” he said. He said the man was taken by MedEvac ambulance and transported to hospital in a stable condition. Daily News
