Dr Kumal Singh, the district medical officer, was the latest witness to testify in the trial of Sewnarain, who is accused of killing his wife Shanaaz in 2010. Sewnarain pleaded guilty, but later made a successful review application at the Pietermaritzburg High Court in 2016. Singh examined the Montclair businessman before he pleaded guilty in 2010. Matthews argued that if Singh started his medical examination at 2.50pm, as he had stated, then he would have had to have done “a rush job” since the magistrate who processed Sewnarain’s confession started it at 3pm. This would be less than the 30- to 60-minute period required for a thorough examination to be conducted. Forms Singh, who is stationed at Addington Hospital, denied he had rushed the exam. Matthews went on to ask him how many J88 forms he filled out a month, to which Singh said “more than 100”. J88 forms are filled in by doctors to document injuries. The documents are used when legal proceedings are going to follow. Matthews argued that Singh did not thoroughly note all Sewnarain’s injuries. He asked Sewnarain to take off his shirt and pointed to a scar on his client’s stomach. Sewnarain said he received the scar in a motorbike crash. Singh said he did not note the scar because he did not see it as relevant, and was looking for recent injuries. He did, however, concede he should have noted it on the J88 form, but not that he did a poor examination. State advocate Cheryl Naidu asked Singh if he noted anything out of the ordinary about Sewnarain. Singh replied that Sewnarain was healthy at the time of the examination. Sewnarain alleged that he was assaulted and strangled by police while in custody. Singh, a doctor for more than 47 years, said he would have noted any strangulation marks. “He did not show any signs of being in pain.” The trial continues on Thursday. Daily News
