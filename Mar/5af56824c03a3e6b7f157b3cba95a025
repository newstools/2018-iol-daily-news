The Monkey Helpline in Durban wants police to conduct a full investigation into the death of a monkey who was shot dead with a handgun. They are now asking for your help in catching the killer. The Community Crime Prevention Organization Amanzimtoti (CCPO) reported that the monkey was shot in Nyala Road with what appears to be a 9mm handgun on 
Wednesday. The CCPO said this was cruel and uncalled for but also incredibly dangerous to residents if the bullet had travelled. They urged anyone with information to pass it on to SAPS or the SPCA. Steve Smit, Monkey Helpline founder, said the monkey had been spotted crawling across a garden by a resident who contacted the Amanzimtoti SPCA. By then the monkey had climbed up a tree and the helpline was called out to assist. "There is a criminal residing in this area. Despite the vet performing emergency surgery, he died from loss of blood and massive internal damage. This person is a criminal and has taken the pellet gun shooting scum bags onslaught to a new level. We have the bullet and would love to catch and prosecute this murderer. Help us before his next victim is someone you know," Smit said. The incident had been reported to the Amanzimtoti SAPS. Anyone with information about who may have shot the monkey have been urged to contact Smit on  082 411 5444. Daily News
