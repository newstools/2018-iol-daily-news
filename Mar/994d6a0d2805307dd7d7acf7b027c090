The contractor is alleged to have portable chemical toilets in 14 wards. Ward councillor Sharon Hoosen said she was informed by city officials that one of the contractors responsible for these toilets in Shallcross had not been paid nearly R3.4 million since September. Hoosen said the toilets had missed two cleaning cycles, leaving them in a putrid state. “At the beginning of each month, the contractor pays a company to clean the toilets three times a week. He could not meet the payments and the cleaning service had to be stopped. The contractor has 400 toilets. Twenty of them are around the Bottlebrush Informal Settlement in Shallcross,” she said. Hoosen has been inundated with calls from Bottlebrush residents about the unhygienic condition of the toilets. Portia Mzimela, a Bottlebrush resident, said the toilets were on the roadside. “Human waste is overflowing on to the floors. Those residents with pit toilets in their backyard are lucky. Some of the residents use the toilets at their workplace. “Others pay R2 to use the toilets at the shopping centre nearby. When we use the sidewalks and bushes we are exposing ourselves. It is degrading to women,” she said. Mzimela showed the Daily News and Hoosen several toilets on Link Road overflowing with human waste. Residents who did not use toilet paper used cardboard and newspapers, causing blockages and overspilling of waste on to the floor. Municipal spokesperson Tozi Mthethwa said contractors or service providers who had not been paid should direct their queries to the relevant municipal department. Daily News
