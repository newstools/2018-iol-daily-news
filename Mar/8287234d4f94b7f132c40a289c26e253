Durban- Police search and rescue teams are still scouring the river banks of the Buffalo River in Dundee, Northern KwaZulu Natal hoping to find a missing police bakkie. The bakkie is crucial to their search because Dundee policeman Warrant Officer Arnesh “Jakes” Juggan, 56, his wife, Molly, 54, and their friend, Ashoak Rajoo, 53 were last seen travelling in it. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, KwaZulu Natal police spokesperson, said the three are still missing and the search will continue. "He was last seen on Friday with his wife and his friend leaving Peaceville area, Dundee in a state motor vehicle. A search is underway and we are appealing to anyone who might have information about his whereabouts to contact the local police station or our Crime Stop number 08600 10111. All three are still missing," Zwane said. The bakkie is alleged to have been washed away while they were trying to cross a low bridge over a stream on the R33 between Dundee and Vryheid. The stream flows into the Buffalo River. Police are searching the area where the last cell phone signal was detected. Dundee and surrounding areas had received heavy rainfalls last week causing small streams, tributaries and rivers to burst their banks Since Saturday search and Rescue teams were faced with swollen and flooded rivers making it difficult for divers to locate the bakkie. Ramil Juggan, the couples son, told the Daily News he was trying to hold up physically but emotionally it was difficult. Ramil has joined the search party since Saturday. He lives with his parents and when he noticed they had not returned home on Saturday he alerted police. Juggan joined the police service 36 years ago. He works at the Dundee police station stock theft unit. Daily News
