Durban - Metro Police officers rushed to clear the roadway in uMlazi, south of Durban following a protest by apparent municipal contract workers on Tuesday. The group dumped rubbish at intersections along the Mangosuthu Highway, blocking the road and causing major traffic delays. This has prompted the city urge residents to keep their refuse bags on their properties until further notice. Tozi Mthethwa, spokesperson for eThekwini Municipality said they were aware of the disruption of refuse removal service in uMlazi. "All relevant stakeholders are being consulted in order to restore the service as soon as possible,” Mthethwa said. In January, the Durban city centre resembled a dump site, with a pungent smell hanging in the air, after the interruption of refuse collection services. This followed a strike by the city’s Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) staff. During the strike, rubbish bins were deliberately overturned, allegedly by people working at Durban Solid Waste (DSW) under the EPWP programme. Daily News
