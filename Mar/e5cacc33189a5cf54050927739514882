Durban - The family of an uMhlali woman who has been in a coma since she was injured when a rock was thrown on her car during a service delivery protest are pleading for the community to pray for their daughter. The parents of Sashni Daniel, 27, said they were praying that their daughter who sustained a fractured skull, three blood clots on her brain and internal swelling during the attack makes a full recovery. Daniel, a sales consultant from KwaDukuza (Stanger) was a passenger in a car when people protesting an 11 hour electricity black out in Shaka's Head threw a rock from a bridge at the vehicle on the N2 last week. She was rushed to Inkosi Albert Luthuli hospital where she was in a critical condition. Dylan Meyrick of IPSS Medical Rescue said: "According to her dad, they have no plans to withdraw life support.They are only requesting people to pray for her.” Meyrick said Daniel’s was the only child to her parents. According to The North Coast Courier, Daniel and her boyfriend’s cousin were travelling on the R102 from Tongaat to Stanger on Sunday night, February 25, when a brick that was thrown by a Shaka’s Head protester hit her on the head, knocking her out. At the time of the incident, Paul Herbst, IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson had said the community was angry because they had not had electricity since a storm which had taken place the Saturday before. In recent months, communities have been living in fear following a spike in rock throwing incidents in KwaZulu-Natal. Some road users were left injured while others lost their lives. As a result, it sparked bridges to be patrolled in order to prevent more rock throwing incidents. Daily News
