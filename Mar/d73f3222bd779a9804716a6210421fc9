Durban- If you are have been following the incredible journey of Pemba the Olive Ridley Turtle you would be delighted to read that she has reached Cape Town. Pemba was released from the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, on the KwaZulu Natal north coast, on March 9. She was fitted with a satellite tracking device attached to her shell. On Saturday Pemba`s satellite position was  190 nautical miles (352 km) south of Cape Agulhas. She is still making good use of the Agulhas current said the South African Association for Marine Biological Research (SAAMBR) on its website. According to the SAAMBR,  Pemba was admitted to the Two Oceans Aquarium turtle rehabilitation and release programme after a boat-based tour operator found her floating in Table Bay Harbour, Cape Town, in December 2014. Initial examination showed a fracture on the side of her shell, presumably from a boat’s propeller. Surgery was performed and the fracture was wired together. The fracture healed within a few months. Pemba was under constant veterinary supervision and was treated for the fractured shell, as well as a suspected lung tear. Numerous efforts to remove large volumes of air from within the turtle’s organs proved unsuccessful. The trapped air caused her to be buoyant so she could not dive down to find food. Treatment continued at the aquarium until September 2016, when she was moved to uShaka Sea World in Durban for further treatment.
Staff at uShaka spent the next 16 months working with Pemba, who still had buoyancy and lung issues. Slowly her diving abilities began to increase. Pemba ate mainly crustaceans and could therefore not be released until she could dive deep enough to find food. Daily News
