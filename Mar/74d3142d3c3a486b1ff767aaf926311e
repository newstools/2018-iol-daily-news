MEC Themba Mthembu weighed in on the land issue during the regional and local economic development summit hosted in Durban this week. He said the government should deal with land expropriation matters decisively. “We cannot succeed in rolling out any successful agricultural programme when the country cannot be decisive on the land issue. When people do not own the land, it is hard for the department to continue with our agricultural programmes. Solutions “With about 70% of people not owning land, how are they to work on agricultural projects? It’s an insult that more than 20 years into democracy, people of indigenous origin only own 4% of the land. “Dealing with the land issue decisively and giving land to the people will be a good move towards achieving good agricultural programmes and success,” Mthembu said. Speaking on the matter of land expropriation without compensation, he said, the liberation struggle was about land. “The land should be given to the people and we should not be apologetic about it.” Mthembu said he hoped the ANC government would put more emphasis on giving land back to the people. “It is disrespectful to call land expropriation without compensation reckless. People were removed from their land and made to work it. Now they should be made to contribute and have an impact in ensuring food security in our poverty-stricken, unequal country. We should not be apologetic because those who own it currently are not apologetic,” he said. Political analyst Dr Bheki Mngomezulu said that the land issue would always be a thorny one as it concerned institutions. “Sometimes you find that land identified for a particular project belongs to more than one institution and the department has to negotiate with all owners. Maybe it is that frustration of going through that process that leads MEC Mthembu to talk like this,” he said. Daily News
