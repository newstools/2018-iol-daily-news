Durban - The investigating officer into the murder of Shanaaz Sewnarain facilitated the purchase of a motorbike between murder accused, Rajiv Sewnarain and a colleague. This was revealed during the testimony of Viresh Panday during Rajiv's retrial in the Durban High Court on Tuesday. Panday said during the investigation, he was asked to facilitate the sale and he had no problem with the deal. “The bike was sold for R40 000 and came with two bike helmets,” he said. The sale of the motorbike was only concluded after Rajiv had been sentenced to life imprisonment after pleading guilty. He also detailed what happened when Rajiv made his guilty plea. “He was very willing to plead guilty,” Panday said. He said Rajiv was cooperative from the time of his arrest. He said both families were shocked at the developments. “They saw her as a good sister-in-law who was a loyal and good person,” Panday said. This is the latest development in the case that has dragged for more than seven years. In 2010, Rajiv was accused of killing his wife, Shanaaz Sewnarain, in what was made to look like a botched hijacking. He confessed to the murder and received a life sentence. He later launched a review application at the Pietermaritzburg High Court, which was granted. Panday will be cross-examined tomorrow by defence advocate, Shane Matthews. The trial continues.
