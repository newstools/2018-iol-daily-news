Durban - Police have shot dead three men, believed to have been involved in a business robbery that claimed the life of a fellow police officer in Maphumulo, south of Durban last month. Members of the Durban Organised Crime and National Intervention unit were following up on information about a group of men involved in the robbery in which Captain Dumisani Mhlanzi was shot dead. Officers traced the men to the KwaMashu area. “When officers approached the men, the suspects fired shots at police. Police fired back, fatally wounding three men. Further investigations led police to a fourth man, in Ntuzuma who is also believed to be linked to the killing,” a source revealed. On February 23, a group of men allegedly entered the hardware and robbed the employees of undisclosed amount of cash and proceeded to the nearest supermarket where they entered using the back entrance. Upon entering, the gang saw the Mhlanzi who was off duty at the time, inside the supermarket. They shot and injured him then they fled using their getaway vehicle. Mhlanzi, 54, was taken to hospital where later died. Daily News
