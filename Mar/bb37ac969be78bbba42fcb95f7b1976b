The seminar was part of the municipality’s attempts to promote the culture of reading among young people. Dr Deena Padayachee, renowned author of What’s Love Got to do With It, and Sandhir Sewmungal, a young author and anti-bullying 
activist, were among the guests. Mbali Gcabashe, Sanele Gamede, Richard T Colombe and Sphesihle Mthana were also on the panel of local authors. Among the topics discussed at the seminar were love, race, the challenges of choosing a career, and gender inequality. The only female author in attendance was Gcabashe, the author of Intimate Thoughts of a Clever Black, who encouraged young women and girls to start writing their own stories. Gcabashe urged men, both young and old, to step up the fight against patriarchy, her call receiving a round of applause from the audience. “It will take all of us working together to defeat patriarchy,” she said. Mthana and Gamede, 
authors of Your Gift is Bigger than a Career and The Graduate Pack respectively, touched on careers and some of the difficulties that young 
people face in choosing the best career path. Gamede told pupils that he looks forward to young people buying his book and gaining the right tips and tricks to do well at job interviews and producing the best CVs. Mthana highlighted the need for young people to find their gifts rather than choosing careers that they wouldn’t enjoy. With bullying prevalent in schools, Sewmungal, who survived bullying, said his book The Unknown Journey told his story and how he did not let his experience prevent him from achieving his goals. Sibongile Doncabe, one of the co-ordinators of the seminar, urged the youth to read local stories and encouraged them to become writers. Representatives of the eThekwini Municipality’s library and heritage department said they would support all authors in KwaZulu-Natal by buying their books and making them available in 
municipal libraries in Durban. Daily News
