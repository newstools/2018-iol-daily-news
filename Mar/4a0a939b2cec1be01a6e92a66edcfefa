Durban - Wentworth woman, Bianca Parsons, was killed in a case of mistaken identity. This was confirmed by the State during the bail application of one of the men accused of the crime in the Durban Regional Court on Wednesday. Parsons was shot in full view of her 3-year-old daughter at a petrol station along Tara Road in February. Darryl Murrison,33, and Christopher Houston, 26, both from Wentworth are facing charges of  murder and attempted murder. In court last week, Murrisson abandoned his bail application. Houston's bail application was however adjourned after investigating officer, Warrant Officer Erugubathy Naidoo, who was giving evidence, asked to take a break in the middle of his cross examination. He complained about the heat in the courtroom. He was later examined by paramedics in the court's waiting area. Naidoo has since been rushed to hospital. Naidoo had told the court that the State had evidence that Parsons' shooting was a case of mistaken identity. He said that Houston and Murrisson were seen, on video footage, driving in a white VW Polo into the petrol station. They were following a red Chery QQ3. He said Parson's red VW Polo vehicle had arrived first and parked while she waited for her husband, who had gone inside a shop at the garage. "Houston was seen taking a gun, which he then tucked into his pants and they both walked to the shop. One of them (Murrisson) bought a pie and a bottle of water and walked out of the shop. Outside Murrisson was seen firing two shots at Parsons who was in the red VW Polo," Naidoo said. Naidoo said an alleged hit was actually intended on another person, seated inside the red Cherry QQ3. It is alleged that the person the men were gunning for, belonged to the family involved in a shooting outside a nightclub in Wentworth last year. In the shooting, a relative of Houston's was killed. Members of the Wentworth community packed the courtroom. They are calling for the court to deny Houston’s bail application. Daily News
