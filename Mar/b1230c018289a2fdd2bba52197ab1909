A pupil told the Daily News that the teacher made racist comments directed at Black pupils. “She would call me a fat baboon because of my weight. She has been doing this since I was in Grade 8. She calls me fat all the time and when I try to report her to other teachers they tell me to calm down,” the pupil said. Other Black pupils said they were constantly questioned by the teacher about why they did not attend schools in their own areas. “She would make the Black boy pupils cut their hair but let the Coloured boys keep their hair if it was straight,” a pupils said. A member of staff at the school claimed that there were teachers who were instigating issues between coloured and Black pupils at the school. “They do not respect the Black pupils. They think they are just stupid,” the staff member said. The school principal declined to comment to the media. Kwazi Mthethwa, KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education media liaison, said they are looking into the matter. Daily News
