“I’m trying to cope with the nightmare,” said Kavita Ramlal. She said she still felt uneasy when she travelled along the stretch of road between Avoca and the KwaMashu off-ramp. Ramlal had been driving behind the truck last week when the plastic corner protectors used for cargo 
fell off and landed in front of her car. She braked hard and could not veer into any other lane because of traffic. “The plastic got stuck under my car - I heard the clapping sound while moving off. I thought I had had a puncture. “I looked in my rear-view mirror and noticed a driver of a car frantically trying to flag me down. I pulled over to the side of the road,” she said. Ramlal got off, with keys in hand, to examine the car. The motorist who saw what happened stopped to help, but then three men walked up and robbed them at gunpoint. “The men stole the good samaritan’s cellphone and wedding rings. “My phone was taken away so swiftly,” Ramlal said. “One of the men yanked my hands and tried to take off my rings. “His accomplice pointed a gun at me. Shaking with fear, I forced my rings off,” she said. “The diamond encrusted band fell on the grass. I thought to step back and stand on it - no such luck. The robber retrieved it. “He yanked my four gold bangles off. The men then scurried down the embankment,” Ramlal said. The police arrived and arrested two of the men. Ramlal later saw an officer hand over cartridges from the suspect’s weapon. Some of the stolen items were also recovered. “Those bullets could have left me dead or maimed for life. My children would have been left without their mother,” she said Ramlal said she had been wearing her rings and wedding band for more than 20 years. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of armed robbery had been opened at the Greenwood Park police station. Daily News
