The hall, once used as a venue to entertain working men during apartheid, is now home to hundreds of residents who have built shacks inside and outside. Umbilo residents believe the hall poses serious health risks to those living inside. According to Mthunzi Gumede, eThekwini mayoral spokesperson, the city is looking into taking over the building. “There’s a process under way to deal with this building and the mayor has requested it be done diligently, legally and faster,” he said. During a raid at the hall on Friday, Umbilo police recovered dangerous weapons and arrested three people. The raid, part of Operation Fiyela2, was carried out by members of the Umbilo police along with specialised SAPS units, metro police and the Department of Home Affairs. Lieutenant-Colonel Stanley Perumal, Umbilo SAPS Visible Policing Commander, said the three men were charged for drug dealing, being in possession of suspected stolen items and dealing in liquor without a licence, respectively. “We recovered one unlicensed firearm and ammunition, three knives, a black Toyota Yaris, which we believe was stolen, and drugs with an estimated street value of R10 000,” he said. Perumal said he was proud of the results yielded by the operation. More operations and raids were planned for the area. “We are committed to ensuring that our community, residential or businesses, are safe,” Perumal said. Twenty-one people had their fingerprints taken using the Max ID machine. Daily News
