A massive cloud of black smoke spread northwards, over the Durban beachfront and as far north as Ballito, dumping black soot across the city. Trevor Stevens, the eThekwini Fire Department’s divisional commander, regarded last year’s March 24 inferno as the biggest building fire on record in the history of the city, and one of the biggest in the country. He said millions of litres of water were used over three days to extinguish the fire. Sections of the building contained copper and toxic chemicals, wax and plastic. Firefighters used lucerne to slow the spread of flames. According to The Independent on Saturday, Transnet said it was in the planning phase of redeveloping the area. The Transnet Board of Enquiry has not yet finalised its report on the blaze. Daily News
