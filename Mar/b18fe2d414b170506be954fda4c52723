She said a concerted effort by all people of integrity was needed to end the corruption that has infiltrated the government. Evelyn Groenink was speaking at the launch of Incorruptible at Durban’s Ike’s Bookstore on Thursday night. Her book tells of the murders of political activists September, Lubowski and Hani, who some believe were assassinated by apartheid forces. But Incorruptible is a reflection of Groenink’s painstaking research that shows their stories a little differently. Groenink shows how all three tried to keep their organisations, the SACP, the ANC and the South West African People’s Organisation (Swapo), free from wrongdoing, and maps out the patterns in their murders. “They stood against mafias who had invaded their movement’s inner circles. They were not only brave anti-apartheid fighters, they were incorruptible,” she said. “We live in a kleptocratic state which was captured a long time ago. It’s not always by the same people and not always in the same way. “We’ve seen friends appoint friends and then they work for who appointed them and not in the public interest.” Although it has been 30 years since September’s death, Groenink says the book raises the spectre of similar, mafia-type deals that may still be claiming victims in South Africa and beyond. The book has already caused controversy - a planned publication in 2005 failed because of myriad threats against the intended publisher, Jacana Media, after comments were invited from a number of individuals mentioned in the book. “It’s not entirely true to say that I’m happy it’s all over. It doesn’t end with the publication of the book. It’s not over,” Groenink said. She lauded civil society, the media, anti-corruption movements and others who form part of the “mass movement of hope”.
