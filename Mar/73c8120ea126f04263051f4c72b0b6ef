Durban - A young honey badger, assumed to be orphaned is being cared for by veterinary staff after he was found injured and in distress on the Western shores of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park last week. Dr Dave Cooper, Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife chief veterinarian said, “While it is not usual practice to intervene in natural processes in wildlife, in this case the badger was in a public area for a couple of days and visible to tourists who were naturally upset and concerned. There was no sign of his mother and we presume that she could have been killed by a predator such as a hyena – one of the few animals bold enough to take on such a feisty target.” Cooper said honey badgers are common residents iSimangaliso and are classed as ‘least concern’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). He said honey badgers are known for their strength, ferocity and toughness, and are intelligent creatures known to make use of tools and ingenuity in both their hunting and escape tactics. He said the honey badger was approximately 3-4 months old and not yet weaned. “He is responding well to nursing care and gaining strength daily,” he continued. “The ultimate goal with all orphans is to be rehabilitated and released back into the wild wherever possible.” Daily News
