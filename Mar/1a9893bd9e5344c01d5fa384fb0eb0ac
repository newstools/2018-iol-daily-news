Durban - Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC cried during a prayer meeting aimed at protecting, saving and prolonging the lives of healthcare workers, especially doctors and nurses. Dhlomo was speaking at a prayer meeting at Addington Hospital on Monday afternoon, in remembrance of the medical professionals who lost their lives. The MEC was overcome with emotion as he remembered some of the medical professionals who died. Agiza Hlongwane, KZN health spokesperson, said the MEC cried because he knew some of the professionals who died personally. “We opted for this prayer after observing and experiencing the continued haemorrhage and demise of our young doctors and nurses in tragic circumstances,” Dhlomo said. “Definitely, we are not singling out doctors because of their status but I think we are all in unison when I say there is no one on this earth who does not need a doctor. Doctors have actually become a part of our lives who we depend upon for minor flu to fractures and complicated surgical procedures,” he said. He said he found it stressful that many doctors and medical students lives were lost during his tenure. Dhlomo said doctors work with dedicated, talented, smart, honest, dependable and altruistic nurses. “Nurses play an intrinsic role in advocating for the curing the sick and wounded, and to ensure that they are nurtured. The work that they do is Godly. They are the backbone of the healthcare system and as such, they should be respected and indeed protected,” he continued. He said that as they have lost doctors, they have also lost nurses in the province. “Today (Monday) I wish to reiterate that in addition to the devastation, pain and human suffering that this is causing when such professionals pass away – we are all at lose,” he said. “We thus appeal to all healthcare professionals to secure their future through taking life covers so that their families are not found wanting in the event of sudden and unexpected death,” he said.
