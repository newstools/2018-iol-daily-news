Durban - With almost one million people expected to flock to Durban for some sun, fun and sea this Easter long weekend, the eThekwini Municipality has issued some tips to keep in mind, in order to be safe. Tozi Mthethwa, head of eThekwini Municipality’s Communications Unit said the city attracts a large number of local and international travellers during the Easter period and is ready to deal with the high traffic volumes expected. “A joint awareness campaign by eThekwini Transport Authority, Metro Police, Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) and The South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) officials to educate taxi drivers and passengers about road safety at various taxi ranks around the City kick-started this week,” she said. Mthethwa said a week-long road safety campaign is expected to cover most taxi and bus ranks, especially the long-distance public transport ranks in eThekwini. “The campaign will conclude by an awareness raising motorcade led by Mayor Zandile Gumede which will run through the city-centre on Thursday, encouraging the community to prioritise road safety. The motorcade will be focused on long distance taxi ranks and it starts at YMCA taxi rank on Thursday and finishes at Williams taxi rank opposite DUT City Campus,” she said.
