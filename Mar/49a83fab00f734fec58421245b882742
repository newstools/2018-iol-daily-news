After fearing that they would be unable to pursue their careers after studying abroad, the 220 students have now been told that they can sit their board exams in South Africa. The Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) had decided to enforce a regulation that returning doctors had to do their internships in the countries where they had studied to make them eligible to write the HPCSAâ€™s board exams enabling them to practice in South Africa. The students said this was impossible because of the difficulty in getting work permits. Now, after an urgent application by a KwaZulu-Natal student, Kapil Sevnaran, to the Gauteng High Court appealing against the decision, the HPCSA has said the affected doctors can write their board exams in South Africa in May, June or October.
