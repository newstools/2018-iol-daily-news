The theme for the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) initiative this year is “Hear the Future”. About 360 million people worldwide have disabling hearing loss and Dr Nivashen Pillay, an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) registrar, said the WHO projected there would be a rise because of bad habits. Pillay suggested people should use headphones to listen to music on phones instead of earphones. “Smartphones have warnings that pop up when the volume is too high but no one pays attention to that. Phone volumes should not be able to go up that high,” he said. Dr John Kutsukutsa, one of the organisers of the silent march, said: “People need to be educated about hearing loss because it is an issue that affects millions of people.” He said hearing loss was costly to the country and urged people to educate themselves on the issue. Dr Muddaseer Khan, an ENT specialist at King Edward VIII Hospital, said: “Hearing loss is a big problem in our communities. It keeps people 
in poverty and they need to realise that hearing loss can be treated and, in most cases, prevented.” He suggested that if parents notice discharge in their children’s ears they must seek medical assistance quickly, to try to prevent any permanent damage. Thobani Khumalo and Phumzile Duma, second-year audiology students, said people did not know enough about audiology and that people, young and old, should get tested. “People must also avoid using ear buds, because it pushes the wax further into the ear. Rather go to an audiologist to help deal with wax, or if you need to have it drained,” said Duma. Daily News
