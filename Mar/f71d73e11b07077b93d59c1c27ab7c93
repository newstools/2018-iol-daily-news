Durban - Four employees at the Mvoti Toll Plaza, north of Durban, were treated for injuries sustained during an assault, early on Tuesday morning. The night before an office belonging to the South African National Roads SOL Limited (Sanral) was burnt down by protesters. The protest stems from a labour dispute between  one of its contractors and its employees has caused traffic disruption close to some of its toll plazas. Last week, Vusi Mona, Sanral spokesperson, said they were concerned tht the labout issues would negatively impact on national road and toll opeartions. "We can assure the public that processes are in place to contain further issues should the labour dispute continue. The toll operator, Intertoll, and the police are involved. The striking workers are employed by Intertoll, a company contracted to SANRAL to manage four of its toll plazas in the country. We are confident that Intertoll, together with South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (SATAWU), which is negotiating on behalf of striking workers, will find an amicable solution very soon so that motorists are not severely affected by any ongoing industrial action," Mona said. On Monday, workers protested at several toll plazas along the N2 and N3. Daily News
