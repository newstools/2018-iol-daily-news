The awards are hailed as the “Oscars of the travel industry”. “It will be an absolute pleasure to return to Durban for the first time since 2009,” said Graham Cook, founder and president of the WTA, in a statement from England. Lindiwe Rakharebe, chief executive of the Durban ICC, said she could not express her excitement at the prospect of hosting the red-carpet gala event, adding that she was 
looking forward to welcoming industry colleagues, friends and media from around the world. It will be the third time that the Durban ICC has hosted the event, the first being in 2008. Hospitality leaders from across the region will gather for the October 6 ceremony to see who has been voted the best in the business, and to see if they are among the winners. The ICC itself has notched up a string of 15 WTA awards for being Africa’s leading meetings and conference centre - and hopes to add to its collection by picking up another honour in October.
