DURBAN - At least one million tourists are expected to descend on KwaZulu-Natal for the Easter long weekend who are expected to spend more than R1 billion, MEC for Economic Development and Tourism, Sihle Zikalala said. According to the department, projections for hotel occupancies are expected to run in excess of 65% when tourists start arriving this week. “We are expecting at least 1-million tourists between April and May which would pump in excess of R1 billion into the province’s purse and create much needed jobs," Zikalala said in a statement on Monday. He said KwaZulu-Natal anticipates traffic volumes in excess of 200 000 on its roads. An equal number of tourists are expected to arrive into the province by air travel. Zikalala added that with the King Shaka International Airport having been recently voted as the Best Regional Airport in the Skytrax Awards, the province was also expecting a marked increase in its air arrival figures. “We recently had two very positive developments which should definitely translate into tourism spin-offs for the province. In the first instance, Durban was chosen as South Africa’s most liveable city and, more recently, the King Shaka International Airport won two international awards for being the best regional airport in Africa, ahead of airports like Tunis in Tunisia and Abidjan in the Ivory Coast.” The airport also registered an overall increase of passengers of 6.4percent in 2017, the highest among all South African airports. “We urge all the people of KwaZulu-Natal to continue to be the best tourism ambassadors for our province and also to have responsible fun during this important holiday period,” said Zikalala.
