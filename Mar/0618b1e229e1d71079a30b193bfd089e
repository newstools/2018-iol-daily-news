In an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes, the crown prince shared his views on different topics, including the country’s dress codes. “The decision on dress code is entirely left to women to decide what type of decent and respectful attire they choose to wear,” he said. The crown prince’s comments have received mixed emotions with some people expressing that Muslim women have always known that they can wear whatever they want as long as it remains respectful and modest. Solly Suleman, the President of the Islamic Medical Association (IMA) said it was known that women were free to wear what they wanted to as long as it was modest. He said the religion did not force women to wear a black abaya or black head cover, and that it was just “sometimes convenient for the woman to wear black”. South African fashion designer Haroun Hansrot said South Africa was different from Saudi Arabia in that South African Muslim women were more liberal in their dress. “I have designed figure-hugging clothes for Muslim women but when they leave their homes they have to wear an abaya over the outfit,” Hansrot said. Dr Fasial Suliman, chairman of the SA Muslim Network, acknowledged that the colour of choice for Muslim women had never been prescribed and added that similar rules of modesty applied to men, too. “The rules are not in place to suffocate or oppress women but, in fact, to free them of lustful gazes and being treated as sex objects, allowing them to operate without sexual harassment,” Suliman said.
