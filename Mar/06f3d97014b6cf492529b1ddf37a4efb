And now, having become one of the 100 semi-finalists in the Tammy Taylor Mrs South Africa contest, she plans to use the opportunity to give herself a “bigger voice” to empower girls. “It will give me a platform to be able to reach more people and become more of a voice in our community,” Makka said on Monday. A former Miss South Africa finalist, the 40-year-old business owner and image consultant was selected for the top 100 at the contest’s first, national casting and empowerment workshop at Emperors Palace in Johannesburg earlier this month. “Through the journey of Mrs South Africa, women learn that they are never too old to follow their dreams and become a voice of change,” she said. “Mrs South Africa has evolved from being a pageant to so much more. It does away with the ideals that do not match real women, but instead showcases true beauty that shines from within and celebrates every woman in her unique femininity,” she said. Passionate about building young girls’ self-esteem, she goes to schools to explain that pupils can be so much more than their circumstances might allow. “I tell them that they can rise above their particular situation if they believe in themselves,” she said. She also discusses the relevant issues that affect society. “In a fatherless society, for instance, young girls often end up looking for love in the wrong places.” The Mrs South Africa contest is linked to the Women4Women South African charity, and Makka is excited about being a semi-finalist and working for the good of the charity. The 25 women who will be selected as finalists will be announced at a charity ball at Emperors Palace on June 29. Daily News
