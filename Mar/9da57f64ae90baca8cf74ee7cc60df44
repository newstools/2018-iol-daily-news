Durban- Police search and rescue teams, comprising members from stations throughout KwaZulu-Natal have converged on Dundee to ramp up their efforts in searching for a policeman, his wife and their friend who are presumed to have drowned during a flash flood in the area last week. Warrant Officer Arnesh "Jakes" Juggan,56, his wife Molly,54, and their friend Ashoak Rajoo,53, have been missing since Friday night. It is believed the police vehicle they were travelling may have been swept in the Buffalo River which burst its banks on Friday. They search is being extended to as far as Vryheid. The northern KZN town experienced heavy rainfall last week which caused rivers and tributaries to burst its banks and cover low bridges in low lying areas.  W. "They were last seen travelling in a police bakkie leaving Dundee," said police spokesperson, Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane. The bakkie had police insignia and markings on it. Police are searching in the area where the couple's last cellphone signals were pinged to. On Tuesday, police rescue teams mapped out the area where they would search. Although the weather in Dundee is humid, a police source said the water level in the river is still high and dangerous for police divers. A search party had been mobilised by midday on Saturday after their son, Ramil Juggan, reported they had not returned home. The Juggan family could not be reached for comment. Daily News
