Durban - A group of 30 protesters waved placards at passing motorists on the N3 Durban bound at the Marianhill Toll Plaza monitored by public order police. The group of workers were permanent and seasonal staff who have embarked on the protest for better working conditions. Staff who spoke on condition of anonymity said they were underpaid yet the Sanral raked in millions per month. Chief Dlamini, SATAWU deputy chairperson for KZN, said they had warned Sanral about the strike two weeks ago. Dlamini said they also asked for the immediate removal of shesha lanes because it was leading to retrenchments. The other grievances were there was no water supply for two weeks to the toll plaza.Staff had to bring their own bottled water. Toilets were flushed using water from a borehole. Staff did not have additional uniforms beside one jersey and reflector vest. The biggest concern said Dlamini were that some were paid between R2 500 and R2 900 per month which was below the minimum wage standards. Dlamini said they will continue with the protest until their demands were met. Daily News
