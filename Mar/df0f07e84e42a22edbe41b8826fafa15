LRC’s regional director, Sharita Samuels, said 570 students from Durban and the province had instructed them to challenge the HPCSA’s rule that forced graduates with foreign qualifications to complete their internships in the country where they studied. Failing to do this would mean graduates would not be able to write their board examinations in South Africa. “These students have studied in China, India, Mauritius and Romania. We are interested in the matter because it impacts on the issue of access to health care in the country, and in the province in particular,” Samuels said. She said they had taken into consideration that medical training differed from country to country, but the objection was that there was no recorded dissatisfaction about the quality of foreign qualifications. The HPCSA rule had been in existence since 2009, but never implemented, she said. IFP chief whip Narend Singh said his party would challenge the 2009 regulation because it made no sense that it was only implemented now. “I already have a motion, which will be discussed on March 30, in front of the health minister,” Singh said last week. DA KZN Health spokesperson Dr Imran Keeka said all foreign-qualified medical students should be treated as Cuban medical students were. The HPCSA did not respond to questions posed to them at the time of publication. The SA Medical Association (Sama) said it had been involved in engagements with the national Health Department. Sama chairperson Dr Mzukisi Grootboom said they were trying to understand what led to the situation. Another Sama member said certain sections of communities wanted to be doctors “come hell or high water”. “They’d do anything to get the title. They then expect to come back and practice on our people. Universities in China, for an example, are not recognised in South Africa,” said the doctor on condition of anonymity. Daily News
