Brian Emmenis, the only permanent air show commentator in Africa, said on Friday it was a “tragedy” that the show, which attracted a wide variety of civilian and military aircraft, had stopped. “It was an institution,” he said. The show ran for 57 years and was the second-longest running civilian air show in the world, after Farnborough in the UK. Organised by the Durban Wings Club, president Stuart Low (now vice-president), said in 2014 new safety standards set by the Civil Aviation Authority reduced the crowd size, making the show “financially impractical”. The regulations stipulated that the crowd had to be no closer than 100 metres from where aircraft were being operated, which would have been almost impossible at Virginia with its many buildings and hangers. Spectators would have to be positioned in front of and between the buildings, bringing the crowd line within 50m of the runway. Emmenis, organiser of 30 shows around KwaZulu-Natal over three years, as well as the 2014 Land, Sea and Air Festival at the Durban beachfront, said he would try to form a task group of influential people to revive the Virginia Air Show. “Just like the Durban July, the Durban Virginia Air Show was one of the events that people had to go to,” he said. Ray de Vries, who handled the media and marketing for the air show for eight years, said on Sunday that it was possible to resurrect the event. “It was a crying shame it was stopped; the people of Durban were robbed,” he said. The rules which killed the event had been in place for years but were never enforced. “For some strange reason,  Raasa (the Recreation Aviation Administration-South Africa) decided to implement them.” It was still possible to accommodate 15000 spectators, De Vries felt. The solution would be to put concrete blocks between the airstrip and the crowd. The call for the show to be revived comes after a drastic drop in Durban’s visitor numbers over the festive season.
