He said the move followed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision in his State of the Nation address last month to conduct lifestyle audits from the top echelons of government down to employees of the State. In his maiden question and answer session in the National Council of Provinces on Wednesday, Mabuza said the ANC was 
committed to conducting the audits. The starting point was for all cabinet members to be audited. Members of Parliament, departmental officials and non-executive directors in state-owned entities would all be audited. “This announcement by the president is not an exercise to please whoever. “It’s an exercise needed by South Africa so that good governance can be projected and upheld, so that those who lead can do so by example,” said Mabuza. “All members of the national executive will have to have lifestyle audits. With regard to rolling this down to MPs, that is the prerogative of the head of state,” he said. A few years ago Cosatu proposed lifestyle audits for all politicians. Civil society also called on the ANC-led government to conduct lifestyle audits for its officials and leaders. Ramaphosa has not given any deadlines. Every year MPs and cabinet members are required to disclose their financial interests in Parliament. The exercise is overseen by the joint ethics committee. If any cabinet member or MP is found to have failed to submit their financial disclosures, they are sanctioned by the committee. Daily News
