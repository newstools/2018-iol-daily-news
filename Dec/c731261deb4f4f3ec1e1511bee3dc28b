Durban - Last Monday was a day of joy, sadness, happiness and so many mixed emotions for everyone at Al-Falaah College as they bid farewell to the class of 2018 on the successful completion of their 12th year in the college. Despite some hard tasks, sadness and grief that they have encountered in the course of their studies in the college, at the end of it all, they completed this part of a journey with great achievements and beautiful memories. It was such a heart-warming and exciting moment as their grade 1 and 2 pupils filled up the ground and balcony levels of the Al-Falaah College corridors as they patiently waited to surprise the Al-Falaah College matric class of 2018 with a “war cry” best wishes send-off and an inspirational gift. The response from the matrics was electrifying and emotional. The Al-Falaah College matric class of 2018 also left behind a legacy as the learners readily donated their school shoes and stationary to the less fortunate, ending their school careers on a positive note. Project Soul 2 Sole was a huge success as we collected a total of 61 pairs of school shoes altogether. There was not a dry eye in the house and certainly an emotional day for all at Al-Falaah College as we bid farewell to the matric class of 2018.
