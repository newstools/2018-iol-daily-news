Madhoo will receive R65 000 to produce a short film. “I am thrilled to be a finalist and winning would be amazing as it would mean I could use the prize to fund my next project,” Madhoo said. She said it had been interesting researching and conceptualising a short film around concrete, and very exciting conceptualising her Virtual Reality (VR) short film. “My last session discussing the idea with the PPC Imaginarium team was inspiring as it both validated my approach and pushed at it in a way that got me to tap further into my strengths,” she said. The film brief was "conceptualise a film idea investigating the role that concrete plays in our environments". She said she interpreted the brief as seeking new ways of conceptualising and imagining concrete. “Concrete for me is part of a technological sublime which I wanted to interpret via VR as an inspiring new media,” she said. Her VR short film concept is “Azimuth”, which explores concrete in the Brutalist style. “Azimuth as a term is derived from medieval Arabic meaning ‘the direction’ and denoting a measurement in a spherical system of 3D space. Azimuth suggests the virtual, 360 VR environment for which the concept will be designed,” she said. “As a product of modernism, Brutalism is an architectural style with concrete as its main element. Concrete is not only the material, but it is also foregrounded aesthetically. The short film proposes imaging style and beauty in a Brutalist architecture and to fuse it with performances of fashion in order to propose an Afro-futurist identity,” she explained. Madhoo and fellow finalist Stefanus Nel will be given R65 000 each to produce and complete their short films between March 29 and April 5, 2019. She said time is tight as the VR production she pitched is ambitious in terms of production and very experimental in execution. The Category Winner in film will receive a R50 000 cash prize. The Film Category winner will be announced on April 18. Daily News
