Durban- KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Sihle Zikalala has welcomed the guilty verdict given to Sodwana Guest House owner Andre Slade. In a press statement, Zikalala said no tourists should be subjected to racial profiling. He said: “I am pleased and satisfied with the findings of the honourable court that Mr Slade’s conduct can never be tolerated in a democratic society. We welcome the findings and we hope this will send a strong message to anyone with intentions to taint our renowned tourism industry or anyone hell-bent on polarizing our society.” He made the remarks after the KwaZulu-Natal High Court ruled against Steyn. In 2016, Slade made national headlines when he replied to an email sent by Sizakele Msimango that his guesthouse no longer welcomed black people and government workers. The furore from this resulted in Zikalala opening charges against him. Slade did not help his cause by arguing that he did not hate black people, but believed that white and black people should not mix. He subsequently lost cases at the Equality Court and was fined R50 000, but appealed it because he believed the magistrate was emotional and did not understand his religious beliefs. “This is why this court judgment is critical to us as it sends out a strong message that KwaZulu-Natal and South Africa in particular. We have no place for people who want to take us back to a period where certain recreational facilities and amenities were the preserve of a certain race at the detriment of others,” he said.
