Minister Pravin Gordhan is helping the almost 57million South Africans, by fighting blatant mismanagement and rampant corruption, by identifying looters and making them accountable through our judiciary. He was removed as finance minister for doing a sterling job and not bowing to political pressure. His credentials are impeccable. Just like Thuli Madonsela, our vibrant and tenacious public protector, who was fearless yet always castigated by people she investigated. She was a real soldier of the poor and downtrodden. At one stage the EFF was fully supportive of Gordhan when he spoke out against state capture. But now Gordhan is facing the same tirade of attacks from the EFF. Recent attacks on the state capture inquiry, headed by Judge Raymond Zondo, and the vitriolic attacks on the minister and his daughter trivialises state capture, yet the commission is uncovering a web of mismanagement spun by ministers. Making unwarranted allegations without proof shows devious and vindictive intent. The EFF, while trying to settle political scores with Gordhan, is not only counter-productive, but is creating animosity among the population. If the EFF have the courage of their conviction, then they must follow the proper channels of the law. For now, letâ€™s leave Gordhan to continue with his task of cleaning up the state enterprises.
