Njabulo Zondi, who works along the promenade as a sand sculptor, said they had not been operational for a few months. “It’s the festive now and these showers must be working,” he said. Zondi said he went to the beach at least three times a week and used water from the showers for his sculptures and after taking a swim. Pensioner Robert Sinner, who also frequents the beachfront, said of the two sets of showers at North Beach, only two showers from one set were working. “Those showers haven’t been working for nine months, and three months ago they started leaking water. When I enquire, I am told the spares to fix them are imported from overseas,” Sinner said, adding that the beachfront was in a bad state. “At least three times this year salt water made its way into the freshwater taps. Local clubs had to buy bottled water to make tea and coffee.” Sinner said the police station was also affected by what he called a simple plumbing issue. In October, the Daily News reported on an electricity box at North Beach that had missing doors and exposed wires. On Thursday, more of these boxes along the beachfront were seen with missing doors. Bongimusa Dlamini, ward 26 councillor, said he was aware of matters brought to his attention, but they faced many challenges. “Some areas are vandalised. It might be the vagrants.” He said people working on Rachel Finlayson pool said it should be ready for use before Christmas Day. The municipality did not comment by the time of publication. Daily News
