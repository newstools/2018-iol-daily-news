Durban - An investigation as to who allowed a civilian mechanical repair workshop to operate on South African Navy property has been ordered by the Chief of the South African Navy. A surprise visit by the Chief of the South African Navy, Vice Admiral Mosiwa Hlongwane, found that the person was apparently running their business from an unused shed on the base. "A whistle-blower reported this situation to the South African Navy Headquarters and that resulted in a surprise visit by the Chief of the South African Navy to SAS WINGFIELD on Thursday," said Commander Greyling van den Berg. "The Chief of the Navy sees this matter in an extremely serious light," added van den Berg. "The Chief will leave no stone unturned to determine who authorised this arrangement and whether any naval officer may have benefited unduly." She concluded by saying that the company would be ordered to vacate the premises. Daily News
