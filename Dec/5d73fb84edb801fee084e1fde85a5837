Motsoeneng, egotistical and megalomaniacal to the end, epitomised almost clinically the kind of degenerative leadership that was entrusted to head institutions of public interest and value. Dithering, stuttering and stammering his way through the interview, he looked like a pathetic creature fighting to survive an inevitable onslaught, where facts were being trumped by the figment of his imagination as he could not proffer direct answers to questions, stumbling and bumbling all the way. Moronic might have been an apt description of his responses, but alas that would be yielding too much credit to a person who really fashioned his world in make-belief and fantasy. His delusions of grandeur were nothing short of stupefying. There can be no doubt that Motsoeneng was by far the greatest disaster to beset the SABC - his disputation of facts against his own perceived opinions, cosmetic dressing of his alleged unfathomable contribution to delivering a profitable and accountable organisation, and in short his despicable condescension in the face of reality makes us ever so thankful that we are no longer subject to his disgraceful buffoonery. He became both the mascot and the flagship of our rapidly degenerating banana republic and any sarcasm or caricature directed at him by the writer is meant with extreme intensity and absolute verve. Thank God Motsoeneng is now a relic on the scrapheap of disasters, as his self-made image putrefies and festers in his own megalomania and almost indecent immodesty. Good riddance, Hlaudi! Daily News
