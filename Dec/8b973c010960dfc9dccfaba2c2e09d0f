Fabiola Macrae said she was “disgusted” at the long wait. “We are waiting outside like stupid people,” Macrae said. The Hillcrest resident said she feared being arrested for having an expired driving licence. Other motorists in the queue of about 100 people said they had been driving for weeks without being able to renew their licences. The situation became tense when a security guard announced that the centre would close at 2pm and would not be admitting anyone after the cut-off time. This angered people who shouted at the guard. Another motorist said she had also gone to the centre on Tuesday and was turned away. She was also scared of being arrested. “I took a selfie of myself so that I could show the police when I get stopped that I was here to try and renew the licence,” she said. Pinetown resident Ntombenhle Zondi said she was considering going to KwaDukuza because she was not getting anywhere in the queue. “I was told that this would be the best place to renew my licence, but I have been waiting for hours now.” Mluleki Mntungwa, KwaZulu-Natal Department of Transport spokesperson, said it was wrong for people to be told to go away after 2pm because everyone in the queue had to be helped. He said the Mariannhill centre had long queues because of the overflow from the Rossburgh testing ground which was experiencing problems. Mntungwa said another reason for the long queues was that schools had closed and people had more time to renew their licences and sort out other motoring issues in the holiday period. He said the licence renewal process was on track and people could renew them because the backlog was being addressed. Mntungwa said the delays in renewing licences was a national issue and not specific to KZN. “We plead with people to be patient and for them to get temporary licences,” he said. Daily News
