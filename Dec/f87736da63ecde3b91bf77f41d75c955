Durban - It has been dubbed the Riverside rejuvenation after security guards were placed along the banks of the Umgeni River. The guards are on patrol between the Durban Bird Park and M4 Blue Lagoon bridge since Saturday.  Shaun Ryley, eThekwini municipality ward 36 councillor said eight security guards will be present daily from 6 am to 7 pm. "It's taken a bit of time but after years of many meetings with stakeholders and city officials, we are finally starting to see the fruits of our labour on the Riverside Road node. The parks department has laid out beautiful flower beds across from the Bird Park as part of beautification efforts. Baby steps - but with this continued hard work we will get there!"Ryley said. The area is frequented by cyclists and tourists. Ryley thanked  Community Policing Forum Chairperson Brian Daish for pushing to get results, Margaret Burger and Siphiwe Rakgabale (Umgeni Estuary Conservancy), Afika Ndima (Catalytic Projects), the Greenhub team, Lazzie Govender (Parks) and countless others who have been involved in making this vision a reality.
