Durban –  There was drama outside courtroom 10 of the Durban Magistrates when a group of cops grabbed hold of Miguel Louw kidnapping accused Mohammed Ebrahim on Monday. Mohammed was shocked when he left the dock after making a brief appearance on charges of kidnapping. He was arrested by top cop, Rajan Govender from the Provincial Organised crime task team who along with his team escorted Mohammed out of the court. Sources said police had rushed him to his house in Phoenix where a search was conducted. The family of Miguel gathered outside the courtroom in celebration when news spread of his arrest. Louw went missing on July 17, near his school in Sydenham, about 25 kilometres from where his corpse was eventually discovered in a shallow grave in Phoenix on September 3, a few hundred metres from Ebrahim’s home. The body was verified as Louw’s nine days after it was discovered via fast-tracking of DNA samples taken from his parents. At Miguel’s memorial service in September, Police Minister Bheki Cele told mourners that Ebrahim’s bail would be “challenged” because of the “strength of the case”. Ebrahim was arrested in July in connection with the child’s kidnapping and then later charged with human trafficking. He was granted bail of R2500 just days before the child’s body was discovered. He was linked to Miguel’s disappearance after CCTV footage identified him taking the boy to a fast food outlet near the child’s school. He was also found to be in possession of the child’s birth certificate. Ebrahim, who was known to the family, has denied any involvement in Miguel’s disappearance. Daily News
