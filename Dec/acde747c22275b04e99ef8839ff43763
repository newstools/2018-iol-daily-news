Durban - The National Sea Rescue(NSRI) Institute's pink buoy initiative has reached the beach shores of KwaDukuza, south of Durban on Wednesday. Quentin Power, a spokesperson for NSRI Station 41- Ballito, said these pink buoys save lives and are unique to sea rescue. "We have them placed all around the country.  They offer buoyancy to a victim or rescuer in time of need. So far they have saved 16 lives, if you make use of one, please make sure you return it so that it may be made available for the next emergency. In The Kwadakuza area, Power said, they have been placed at Zinkwazi,  Salt Rock hotel by the tidal pool and Salmon Bay. Tips from NSRI to swim in safe zones: Rule number one for a safe experience at the beach is to choose a beach that has lifeguards on duty and to swim between their flags. That way you don’t need to worry about rip currents, or suddenly getting out of your depth. Putting an arm in the air and waving for help will get a rapid response from the Lifeguards on duty. Unfortunately, for various reasons, people regularly swim where there are no lifeguards on duty. This may be on a beach after the Lifeguard’s duty has finished or at a beach that does not have lifeguards.  Daily News
