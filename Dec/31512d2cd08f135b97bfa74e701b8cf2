Durban - A wall of solidarity was established within the Brighton Beach police station for police officers to pledge their solidarity towards the fight against HIV and AIDS. From November 25, Brighton Beach police launched its 7 days of solidarity initiatives in the fight against HIV/Aids.  The theme being 'Think Global, Act Local'. Captain Louise Le Roux, the Brighton Beach police spokesperson and project manager, said police officers face two life-threatening situations daily. Police could be killed in the line of duty or contract HIV/AIDS while interacting with criminals or victims of crime. "The 7 days of solidarity project allowed for members who are performing duties on a shift basis to become aware of these threats. On a daily basis I have addressed members on parade on reporting procedures to be complied with when they have been exposed," she said. Police officers received an educational brochure on facts and myths surrounding HIV/Aids, were informed on the correct way of using a male and female condom with visual aids and received condoms which were supplied by the Masibambisane ARV’s Clinic situated at Wentworth Hospital. Police officers also donned red chest ribbons. "These cardboard ribbons have been laminated and placed on the wall of solidarity to showcases SAPS  employees commitment towards the fight against HIV/Aids. A white candle with a red ribbon was lit daily to show support to those infected and affected by HIV/Aids," Le Roux said. A total of 150 brochures and condom packs were distributed during the SAPS, Brighton Beach gender mainstreaming programme. Daily News
