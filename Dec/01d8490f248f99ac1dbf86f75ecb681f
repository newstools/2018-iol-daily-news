Durban -  An Umhlatuzana family was held up at gunpoint and tied up in their home near Chatsworth on Thursday. Sivan Subramodey, of a private security company Amawele security and paramedic services, said a gang of robbers had parked their car a few houses away and were walking around scouting when they came across the house with unlocked doors and gates on 27th Avenue just after  10 pm. "They tied up the family, assaulted them and took household appliances and valuables. The robbers pushed a piece of cloth into the victim's mouths to prevent them from screaming. The family had made themselves easy targets. We urge residents to be vigilant and lock their gates and doors. I understand it was hot that evening," Subramody said. Amawele Paramedics stabilised the family but they refused to be taken to a hospital said Subramody. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said the complainant was at his home in Mhlathuzana area with his family when five unknown men entered through an unlocked door. "At gunpoint the robbers forced the occupants onto the floor. They tied them with shoelaces and ransacked the house. The robbers took a TV set, cellphones, play station and handbags and fled the scene. A case of robbery is being investigated by Bayview SAPS," Gwala said. Daily News
