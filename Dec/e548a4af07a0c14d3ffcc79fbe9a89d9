The concern was raised yesterday by Sassa spokesperson Vusi Mahaye, who said that many people still had to make the switch. This comes after Black Sash on Wednesday urged grant beneficiaries to get their new cards before the December 15 cut-off date. Black Sash said beneficiaries would not be able to receive their grants next year using the old white cards. Mahaye said they had completed the registration process of people who used biometrics by September. The number of people switching cards was not increasing as they had expected, and the number of staff at their offices tended to decrease during the holiday period, he said. To make matters worse, Sassa could not make pre-approved cards for grant recipients as there was a chance that they could be exploited by criminals. The switch to the new cards is the latest development in a saga that has lasted for more than a year, has affected millions of grant recipients and resulted in court battles between the Department of Social Development and Black Sash over how payments are made to beneficiaries. Pensioner Margaret Govender said she had changed to the new card as soon as the announcement was made. The 65-year-old former teacher, who is part of a senior citizensâ€™ club, said she had taken more than 30 pensioners to have their cards changed in time. Black Sash advocacy manager Hoodah Abrahams-Fayker said Sassa should assess its communication strategy used in getting the message to people to switch to the new cards. She said Sassa should have made contingency plans for the December period when there would be less staff at its offices. Abrahams-Fayker said the message should be communicated to areas where few people had migrated to the new card. Daily News
