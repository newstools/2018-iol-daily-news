This was according to Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, who said officers had attended to 60 minor and serious collisions this weekend alone. From January this year to date, the metro police had arrested 5180 drunk drivers. “This is a high figure for drunk driving. People are just not adhering to the rules of the road,” said Sewpersad. He said six cars were towed in Durban, some of which were illegally parked, while others had been abandoned. In addition, a total of 28 taxi drivers were charged for overloading, with the highest related fine being R7500. Sewpersad said the Metro police would intensify their operations this festive season, including at Durban's beaches. “This weekend we also charged people for public drinking at the Durban beachfront. We will intensify undercover and normal operations this coming weekend too,” he said. Sewpersad said they had deployed extra personnel for patrols at the beaches. “We are not introducing the driver permits at the beachfront this time around, but we will not allow cooler bags with alcohol,” he said.
