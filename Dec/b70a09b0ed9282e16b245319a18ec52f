According to Abahlali’s Thapelo Mohapi, the adjournment was intended to give the municipality and Human Settlements Department time to prepare supplementary responding affidavits. In the interim there were to be no further evictions and no erection of any new structures. The movement made the application after 46 shacks were demolished and three torched, allegedly by the unit during evictions last Thursday at Khenana Informal Settlement in Cato Crest. A number of people were injured last month when the unit dispersed residents using rubber bullets and tear gas during an eviction. The movement claimed the evictions were done without a court order as prescribed by law. Mohapi said at Khenana this year alone shacks had been demolished 12 times. Metro Police spokesperson Parboo Sewpersad however said the unit carried out evictions properly with the help of the city's legal services. “They have the authority to carry out these evictions,” he said. Commenting on allegations that the unit used live ammunition and brutal force during the evictions, Sewpersad encouraged residents to open cases with the SAPS. “They have to go to their nearest police station to report and it is SAPS who will investigate,” he said. Outside court yesterday, Khenana resident Nosipho Ntuli said they began rebuilding their demolished shacks last Thursday after the unit had left. “We used what was left of the material when our shacks were torn down, and we all gave what was left of the little material we had to three neighbours who had their shacks set alight so that they would have somewhere to sleep that night,” she said. Landiwe Radebe said her shack was also torched this year, allegedly by the unit which had come to evict them. “When they burn our shacks, they don't give us an opportunity to get our belongings out. “This means we lose everything, including ID books and furniture,” she said.
