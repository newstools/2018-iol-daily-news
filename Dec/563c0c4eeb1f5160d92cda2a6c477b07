In recent weeks there have been reports of smash-and-grabs from victims and witnesses in the area. Bulwer Safety and Urban Regeneration Forum (BSURF) chairperson Heather Rorick said they had alerted both Umbilo and Berea police, who would place unmarked vehicles to monitor the area, even though they were working with limited resources. She said about a week ago police arrested a man in connection with the theft of a cellphone in the area. Rorick urged motorists to drive with their windows up, only leaving a little gap if necessary. She said some people were still driving with handbags and cellphones visible. Berea CPF chairperson Paul Antao said although Tollgate bridge does not necessarily fall under Berea, crime in that area was still of concern to them. “Sometimes it is our people who are victims and sometimes criminals from there cross over into our area, so it is a concern to us,” Antao said. He concurred with Rorick that despite awareness, valuables were still being left visible inside vehicles. “Traffic is slow moving on Tollgate bridge, so criminals take a chance,” he said. Both SAPS and Metro police said there were no recent records of robberies from Tollgate bridge registered at Umbilo and Mayville SAPS. Metro Police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad urged victims of smash-and-grabs to report these incidents so they could take action. He said few cases were reported to the police and these were usually for insurance claims. Sewpersad said SAPS could ask Metro Police to view footage of crimes reported in that area to try and identify the criminals. “The cameras in the area are more fixed on the roadway, but we can change the focus depending on the crime and grime in the area,” Sew­persad said.
