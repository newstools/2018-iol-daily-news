Durban - Residents in the Waterfall area of Hillcrest woke up to the sound of gunshots on Sunday night. Steven King coordinator of the South African Community Crime Watch in KwaZulu-Natal said a panic alarm was pressed in Brackenhill Road just after 10 pm after residents heard what sounded like automatic gunfire near Mkusi place intersection. King said when police investigated they found out there was an armed robbery involving eight men. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said that Hillcrest police officers were conducting crime prevention duties at KwaNgcolosi when they stopped at a shop near Mkhulu’s tavern. "A police officer walked into the shop, unaware of a robbery at the tavern, As he walked in, he was approached by a group of men who overpowered him and disarmed him of his service pistol," he explained. The men fled the scene using their getaway vehicle with stolen items such as cigarettes, liquor, cash, cellphones and laptops. The police officers gave chase and it is alleged that during the chase, there was an exchange of gunfire between police and the men. "The getaway vehicle came to a standstill. The men attempted to flee on foot while shooting at the police officers. Police retaliated and one suspect was fatally wounded whilst the second suspect was injured. A third suspect was later arrested by police officers from the K9 Unit."Zwane said. One of the injured men was taken to hospital under police guard. Police officers recovered two firearms including the one that was taken from the police officer. Zwane said the arrested men will be profiled to establish if they are wanted for other crimes in the country. The arrested men will appear in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court. They have been charged with armed robbery, attempted murder and possession of illegal firearm and ammunition at the Hillcrest SAPS. Daily News
