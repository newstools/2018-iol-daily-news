Metro Police spokesperson Parboo Sewpersad said fireworks are to be used in a responsible and considerate manner with due respect for neighbours and animals. “Please ensure that your pets are fitted with a collar with an identification tag on which states your home address and telephone number,” he said. Sewpersad said prohibitions relating to the use of fireworks include that it is unlawful for any person to point or direct a firework at any person, animal, building or motor vehicle. “No person shall light or detonate fireworks in any place where animals are kept; and no person may terrify, cause stress or endanger the life of any animal with fireworks or by any other means,” he said. Sewpersad added that consumer fireworks that were low-hazard were the only ones permitted to be set off in residential areas. These were only to be set off on December 31 from 11.45pm to 12.15am. Sewpersad said fire safety officers from eThekwini’s Fire Department check for permits and licences at shops selling fireworks. Division Commander Alfred Newman said they conducted these checks routinely throughout the year. “We check for permits all the time. In addition, anyone who has a fireworks display has to apply for approval from the municipality,” he said. Daily News
