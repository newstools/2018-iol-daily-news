Durban - Groot, the penguin, made it onto shore on Monday on Scottburgh’s busy main beach. The penguin had been spotted by fishermen in Pennington and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife honorary officer, Nigel Eady, alerted uShaka Sea World. When it was seen again on Monday, a lifeguard, Elliot (Egg) Hall had seen a group of children chasing it with a stick and moved the penguin to safety. “Groot is an African penguin about 18 months old and about to moult into adult plumage. The left flipper has an infected wound which is being treated. Understandably the bird is quite stressed and exhausted, so plenty rest, rehydration and food from the team at uShaka Sea World will aid the recovery process,” the South African Association for Marine Biological Research (Saambr) said on their Facebook page. Please report stranded animals to uShaka Sea World as soon as possible: 031 328 8222 or 031 328 8060. Daily News
