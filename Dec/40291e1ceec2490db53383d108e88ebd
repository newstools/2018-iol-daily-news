Durban - Residents of Phoenix, north of Durban, need to do more to prevent criminals from taking over the suburb said Umesh Singh, Phoenix Community Policing Forum Chairperson. Singh was speaking after the shooting of Phoenix businessman Imran Hussain, 32, who risked his life to save a woman that was being beaten and robbed on Fernham Drive and Highstone Place intersection. Hussain was shot twice on his leg. He is recovering in hospital. He managed to defend himself by shooting one of the robbers. The robber is under police guard said police spokesperson Captain Ngobile Gwala. The incident is being investigated at the Phoenix police station. Singh said it was a blessing Hussain was there. "What would have happened to the woman that was being robbed? She could have been killed, kidnapped and raped. It was a rather unfortunate incident. The police are trying to get more details from the woman who is also recovering in hospital," Singh said. Singh said there have been a number of robbery and theft incidents reported and not reported especially in the Fernham Drive vicinity. The road is a major thoroughfare that also links Phoenix with Bhambayi. "His decision was quick when he realised the woman's life was in danger. He put his life at risk. We urge the community to be aware of their surroundings in public places. We urged Police to beef up patrols not only in this area but in the greater Phoenix area. The community must report all crimes,"Singh said. Singh urged the community to come out in their numbers and join or form neighbourhood watches or street committees to prevent and deter crime from happening. Daily News
