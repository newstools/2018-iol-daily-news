The Daily News was told by at least two sources that an urgent caucus meeting had been called following reports on Sunday that the party’s parliamentary caucus was plotting to oust Mncwango. This followed revelations of chief whip John Steenhuisen’s lack of a post-matric qualification. The party’s leadership, both provincial and national, did not confirm or deny the alleged move to get rid of Mncwango. The revelation about Steenhuisen’s lack of a tertiary qualification came after last week’s reports that the DA provincial caucus had proposed that only MPs with a university degree be considered for the position of chief whip. This would mean that Steenhuisen would be demoted after next year’s elections if his party’s proposal was considered. Mncwango was reportedly blamed by some party leaders and accused of attempting to remove his comrade from the chief whip’s position. Steenhuisen has since defended his lack of a qualification. Mncwango declined to comment on the matter, saying only that the provincial caucus had never discussed individuals, but had discussed a document which the party had received - with recommendations - from the Independent Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers. The document was for all provincial and national parliamentary representatives, and all political parties received it. It was unfortunate that the issue had been personalised, he said. When asked about the meeting yesterday, he said he would not comment on what had been discussed. The party’s provincial communications office sent an email to the Daily News stating that party provincial chairperson Francois Rodgers had requested that Athol Trollip, the federal chairperson, be contacted regarding information on the meeting. When contacted, Trollip said: “I never discuss party matters in the media. We have internal party mechanisms to deal with any issues when they arise.” Daily News
