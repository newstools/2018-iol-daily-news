Absolom Mduduzi Khumalo lived alone at his homestead at Ngcolosi Reserve. His body was found in a badly decomposed state buried under cardboard boxes in his home, a week after his family discovered that he was missing. Qinisela Mbambo, 28, and Nduduzo Tineza, 27, were arrested shortly after Khumalo's body was found. Prosecutor Khatija Essack relied on a confession Mbambo made to police shortly after his arrest, and the evidence of two other accused who, although they were not at the scene and party to the murder, bought Khumalo's vehicle from Mbambo and Tineza. Another accused, who turned State witness, was found with Khumalo’s stolen items, and had said Mbambo and Tineza had asked him to keep the goods for them. Judge Nompumelelo Radebe found the State had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. Khumalo was accosted outside his home at gunpoint and beaten to death. The killers left with Khumalo’s bakkie, his cellphone, and gas stove and cylinder. Judge Radebe said Mbambo and Tineza showed no remorse for their actions and had not taken the court into their confidence. The judge refused Mbambo and Tineza’s application for leave to appeal their conviction and sentence, saying the appeal had no prospects of success in another court. Daily News
