Durban - He wrote the hit song, 'Happy'. But after spending a few days in South Africa and having to put up with hadedas, let's just say Pharrell Williams is not a happy chappy. Williams was in town for the Global Citizen Festival that took place at the weekend. The event also featured the likes of Cassper Nyovest and Beyoncé. In the video, posted on Monday night, Williams is seen sitting down and asking "What the F is that?" when the birds begin to uhmmm... sing? In the second video, again he asks, "What the F is that bro?"     Pharrell getting triggered by hadedas is the best thing on the internet today. Welcome to South Africa @Pharrell! 😂🇿🇦 pic.twitter.com/8InJTqfr9N The post has already been shared more than 3000 times with over 1000 comments.
