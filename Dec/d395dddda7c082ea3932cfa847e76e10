Durban - A private security company in the north of Durban have taken it upon themselves to find the person who dumped more than a hundred fish on the side of Oaklands Drive in Verulam on Monday. Prem Balram, spokesperson for Reaction Unit South Africa said a disgruntled homeowner discovered the fish dumped under a tree in the residential area. Balram said a bakkie was seen driving off from the vacant property on the border of a gorge and residential houses. Johnson Chetty, eThekwini ward 106 councillor, said the fish were dumped in the area on Saturday. "Flies are gathering around the fish. We are lucky to experience cooler weather this weekend otherwise the stench would have been unbearable to the residents living in close proximity. I have contacted the relevant eThekwini departments including the department of health. I hope to have the placed cleared by the end of the day. We have an idea of who might have done it and officials are investigating," Chetty said. If you have any information regarding the person or business that dumped this load of fish, please contact Reaction Unit South Africa on 0861234333. Daily News
