Uttering harmful words, or singing hate-filled songs that could be interpreted as being capable of inciting anger or violence against any community, must be condemned. An attack on any human being is an attack on all of us, as we all form part of the big human family. As a nation of revolutionaries who opposed apartheid, we all should voice our disgust with damage-causing speech. We are a nation guided by the belief that we are all created equal and are accountable to the constitution. I support free speech, believing it to be the foundation of democracy. But this opinion is based on the understanding that freedom of expression is not absolute and is only good if used in nation-building and promotion of human rights. Statements shape the way we think and, in this constantly evolving process of dialogue, language forms the basis for action. Therefore, speech that incites harm should face the full might of our judicial process. MOHAMED SAEED Pietermaritzburg
