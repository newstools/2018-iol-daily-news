The pastor, who cannot be named as he has yet to plead, faces a charge of kidnapping, two counts of rape, and a case of sexual assault. Some of the complainants in the case are said to be minors. In her bail decision on Tuesday, Ntuzuma magistrate Busisiwe Mkhulisi said the bail application was not a trial, and that the court looked at all the evidence presented. Last month, the man was arrested after cases were opened against him. The pastor has six branches of his church, with around 2500 members. The anger of community members led to the marquee that he operated from being torn down. Later, congregants tried to put it up but were prevented by community members. When Mkhulisi denied him bail, the pastorâ€™s supporters who had filled the gallery started to cry, while one of his followers began to hyperventilate. Prosecutor Sibongile Ngcobo had argued that there was strong evidence the pastor had committed the crimes he was charged with and that he should be denied bail. She referred to testimony by the investigating officer, Dorothy Khwela, who had testified that the pastor had told someone in a recorded phone call that a deal must be struck with one of the complainants. The pastor was also recorded saying that his Facebook account must be cleaned of incriminating evidence. Defence attorney Sandile Shoba said the State was speculating and had not shown that the pastor would be a flight risk. The pastor next appears in court on January 21.
