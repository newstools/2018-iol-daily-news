The Daily News reported last week on the state of parts of the beachfront, including broken showers, the Rachel Finlayson pool and electricity boxes with missing doors. eThekwini spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said they had appointed a contractor to repair the showers at North Beach. “There is an issue with procuring some parts needed to repair some showers. However, the city will do its best to ensure that the showers are fixed and that this does not affect the festive season,” Mayisela said, adding that a technician was tasked to attend to the matter of the missing doors on the electricity boxes. He urged people to urgently contact the electricity department at 0803111111 or email custocare@elec.durban.gov.za to report such matters. He said the city had contracted 12 service providers to provide litter picking and cleaning services at specific beach nodes. The central beachfront is segmented into nine cleaning zones, with service providers managing specific areas on set days and with provision for additional shift days. Mayisela said there would be two additional roving teams, which would respond to the problematic and highly frequented areas. He added that the pumping of sand was almost complete and would stop during the December holidays.
